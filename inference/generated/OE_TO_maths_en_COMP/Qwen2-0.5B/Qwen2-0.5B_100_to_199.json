            "We will prove that the largest possible number $k$ of indices satisfying the given condition is one.\n\nFirstly we prove that $b_{2009}, r_{2009}, w_{2009}$ are always lengths of the sides of a triangle. Without loss of generality we may assume that $w_{2009} \\geq r_{2009} \\geq b_{2009}$. We show that the inequality $b_{2009}+r_{2009}>w_{2009}$ holds. Evidently, there exists a triangle with side lengths $w, b, r$ for the white, blue and red side, respectively, such that $w_{2009}=w$. By the conditions of the problem we have $b+r>w, b_{2009} \\geq b$ and $r_{2009} \\geq r$. From these inequalities it follows\n\n$$\nb_{2009}+r_{2009} \\geq b+r>w=w_{2009}\n$$\n\nSecondly we will describe a sequence of triangles for which $w_{j}, b_{j}, r_{j}$ with $j<2009$ are not the lengths of the sides of a triangle. Let us define the sequence $\\Delta_{j}, j=1,2, \\ldots, 2009$, of triangles, where $\\Delta_{j}$ has\n\na blue side of length $2 j$,\n\na red side of length $j$ for all $j \\leq 2008$ and 4018 for $j=2009$,\n\nand a white side of length $j+1$ for all $j \\leq 2007,4018$ for $j=2008$ and 1 for $j=2009$. Since\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(j+1)+j>2 j & \\geq j+1>j, & & \\text { if } \\quad j \\leq 2007 \\\\\n2 j+j>4018 & >2 j \\quad>j, & & \\text { if } j=2008, \\\\\n4018+1>2 j & =4018>1, & & \\text { if } j=2009\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nsuch a sequence of triangles exists.

            "The identity function $f(x)=x$ is the only solution of the problem.\n\nIf $f(x)=x$ for all positive integers $x$, the given three lengths are $x, y=f(y)$ and $z=$ $f(y+f(x)-1)=x+y-1$. Because of $x \\geq 1, y \\geq 1$ we have $z \\geq \\max \\{x, y\\}>|x-y|$ and $z<x+y$. From this it follows that a triangle with these side lengths exists and does not degenerate. We prove in several steps that there is no other solution.\n\nStep 1. We show $f(1)=1$.\n\nIf we had $f(1)=1+m>1$ we would conclude $f(y)=f(y+m)$ for all $y$ considering the triangle with the side lengths $1, f(y)$ and $f(y+m)$. Thus, $f$ would be $m$-periodic and, consequently, bounded. Let $B$ be a bound, $f(x) \\leq B$. If we choose $x>2 B$ we obtain the contradiction $x>2 B \\geq f(y)+f(y+f(x)-1)$.\n\nStep 2. For all positive integers $z$, we have $f(f(z))=z$.\n\nSetting $x=z$ and $y=1$ this follows immediately from Step 1 .\n\nStep 3. For all integers $z \\geq 1$, we have $f(z) \\leq z$.\n\nLet us show, that the contrary leads to a contradiction. Assume $w+1=f(z)>z$ for some $z$. From Step 1 we know that $w \\geq z \\geq 2$. Let $M=\\max \\{f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(w)\\}$ be the largest value of $f$ for the first $w$ integers. First we show, that no positive integer $t$ exists with\n\n$$\nf(t)>\\frac{z-1}{w} \\cdot t+M,\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\notherwise we decompose the smallest value $t$ as $t=w r+s$ where $r$ is an integer and $1 \\leq s \\leq w$. Because of the definition of $M$, we have $t>w$. Setting $x=z$ and $y=t-w$ we get from the triangle inequality\n\n$$\nz+f(t-w)>f((t-w)+f(z)-1)=f(t-w+w)=f(t)\n$$\n\nHence,\n\n$$\nf(t-w) \\geq f(t)-(z-1)>\\frac{z-1}{w}(t-w)+M\n$$\n\na contradiction to the minimality of $t$.\n\nTherefore the inequality (1) fails for all $t \\geq 1$, we have proven\n\n$$\nf(t) \\leq \\frac{z-1}{w} \\cdot t+M\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\ninstead.\n\n\n\nNow, using (2), we finish the proof of Step 3. Because of $z \\leq w$ we have $\\frac{z-1}{w}<1$ and we can choose an integer $t$ sufficiently large to fulfill the condition\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{z-1}{w}\\right)^{2} t+\\left(\\frac{z-1}{w}+1\\right) M<t .\n$$\n\nApplying (2) twice we get\n\n$$\nf(f(t)) \\leq \\frac{z-1}{w} f(t)+M \\leq \\frac{z-1}{w}\\left(\\frac{z-1}{w} t+M\\right)+M<t\n$$\n\nin contradiction to Step 2, which proves Step 3.\n\nFinal step. Thus, following Step 2 and Step 3, we obtain\n\n$$\nz=f(f(z)) \\leq f(z) \\leq z\n$$\n\nand $f(z)=z$ for all positive integers $z$ is proven."

        "question": "On a $999 \\times 999$ board a limp rook can move in the following way: From any square it can move to any of its adjacent squares, i.e. a square having a common side with it, and every move must be a turn, i.e. the directions of any two consecutive moves must be perpendicular. A nonintersecting route of the limp rook consists of a sequence of pairwise different squares that the limp rook can visit in that order by an admissible sequence of moves. Such a non-intersecting route is called cyclic, if the limp rook can, after reaching the last square of the route, move directly to the first square of the route and start over.\n\nHow many squares does the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a limp rook visit?",
        "solution": [
            "First we show that this number is an upper bound for the number of cells a limp rook can visit. To do this we color the cells with four colors $A, B, C$ and $D$ in the following way: for $(i, j) \\equiv(0,0) \\bmod 2$ use $A$, for $(i, j) \\equiv(0,1) \\bmod 2$ use $B$, for $(i, j) \\equiv(1,0) \\bmod 2$ use $C$ and for $(i, j) \\equiv(1,1) \\bmod 2$ use $D$. From an $A$-cell the rook has to move to a $B$-cell or a $C$-cell. In the first case, the order of the colors of the cells visited is given by $A, B, D, C, A, B, D, C, A, \\ldots$, in the second case it is $A, C, D, B, A, C, D, B, A, \\ldots$ Since the route is closed it must contain the same number of cells of each color. There are only $499^{2} A$-cells. In the following we will show that the rook cannot visit all the $A$-cells on its route and hence the maximum possible number of cells in a route is $4 \\cdot\\left(499^{2}-1\\right)$.\n\nAssume that the route passes through every single $A$-cell. Color the $A$-cells in black and white in a chessboard manner, i.e. color any two $A$-cells at distance 2 in different color. Since the number of $A$-cells is odd the rook cannot always alternate between visiting black and white $A$-cells along its route. Hence there are two $A$-cells of the same color which are four rook-steps apart that are visited directly one after the other. Let these two $A$-cells have row and column numbers $(a, b)$ and $(a+2, b+2)$ respectively.\n\n<img_3906>\n\nThere is up to reflection only one way the rook can take from $(a, b)$ to $(a+2, b+2)$. Let this way be $(a, b) \\rightarrow(a, b+1) \\rightarrow(a+1, b+1) \\rightarrow(a+1, b+2) \\rightarrow(a+2, b+2)$. Also let without loss of generality the color of the cell $(a, b+1)$ be $B$ (otherwise change the roles of columns and rows).\n\nNow consider the $A$-cell $(a, b+2)$. The only way the rook can pass through it is via $(a-1, b+2) \\rightarrow$ $(a, b+2) \\rightarrow(a, b+3)$ in this order, since according to our assumption after every $A$-cell the rook passes through a $B$-cell. Hence, to connect these two parts of the path, there must be\n\n\n\na path connecting the cell $(a, b+3)$ and $(a, b)$ and also a path connecting $(a+2, b+2)$ and $(a-1, b+2)$.\n\nBut these four cells are opposite vertices of a convex quadrilateral and the paths are outside of that quadrilateral and hence they must intersect. This is due to the following fact:\n\nThe path from $(a, b)$ to $(a, b+3)$ together with the line segment joining these two cells form a closed loop that has one of the cells $(a-1, b+2)$ and $(a+2, b+2)$ in its inside and the other one on the outside. Thus the path between these two points must cross the previous path.\n\nBut an intersection is only possible if a cell is visited twice. This is a contradiction.\n\nHence the number of cells visited is at most $4 \\cdot\\left(499^{2}-1\\right)$.\n\nThe following picture indicates a recursive construction for all $n \\times n$-chessboards with $n \\equiv 3$ mod 4 which clearly yields a path that misses exactly one $A$-cell (marked with a dot, the center cell of the $15 \\times 15$-chessboard) and hence, in the case of $n=999$ crosses exactly $4 \\cdot\\left(499^{2}-1\\right)$ cells.\n\n<img_3771>"

Since $K$ and $I$ lie on the angle bisector of $\\angle A C D$, the segments $I D$ and $I F$ are symmetric with respect to the line $I C$. Hence there is a point $S$ on $I F$ where the incircle of triangle $A D C$ touches the segment $I F$. Then segments $K P, K Q, K R$ and $K S$ all have the same length and are perpendicular to $A D, D C, C A$ and $I F$, respectively. So - regardless of the value of $\\angle B E K$ - the quadrilateral $K R F S$ is a square and $\\angle S F K=\\angle K F C=45^{\\circ}$.\n\nConsider the case $\\angle B A C=60^{\\circ}$ (see Figure 1). Then triangle $A B C$ is equilateral. Furthermore we have $F=E$, hence $\\angle B E K=\\angle I F K=\\angle S E K=45^{\\circ}$. So $60^{\\circ}$ is a possible value for $\\angle B A C$.\n\nNow consider the case $\\angle B A C=90^{\\circ}$ (see Figure 2). Then $\\angle C B A=\\angle A C B=45^{\\circ}$.

Hence triangle $I E A$ is isosceles and a reflection of the bisector of $\\angle I A E$ takes $I$ to $E$ and $K$ to itself. So triangle $I K E$ is symmetric with respect to this axis, i.e. $\\angle K I E=\\angle I E K=\\angle B E K=45^{\\circ}$.

(However, for $\\angle B A C=90^{\\circ} E$ lies, in fact, between $F$ and $C$, see Figure 2.

            "Such a sequence exists for $n=1,2,3,4$ and no other $n$. Since the existence of such a sequence for some $n$ implies the existence of such a sequence for all smaller $n$, it suffices to prove that $n=5$ is not possible and $n=4$ is possible.\n\nAssume first that for $n=5$ there exists a sequence of positive integers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{5}$ satisfying the conditions\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& a_{2}^{2}+1=\\left(a_{1}+1\\right)\\left(a_{3}+1\\right), \\\\\n& a_{3}^{2}+1=\\left(a_{2}+1\\right)\\left(a_{4}+1\\right), \\\\\n& a_{4}^{2}+1=\\left(a_{3}+1\\right)\\left(a_{5}+1\\right) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAssume $a_{1}$ is odd, then $a_{2}$ has to be odd as well and as then $a_{2}^{2}+1 \\equiv 2 \\bmod 4, a_{3}$ has to be even. But this is a contradiction, since then the even number $a_{2}+1$ cannot divide the odd number $a_{3}^{2}+1$.\n\nHence $a_{1}$ is even.\n\nIf $a_{2}$ is odd, $a_{3}^{2}+1$ is even (as a multiple of $a_{2}+1$ ) and hence $a_{3}$ is odd, too. Similarly we must have $a_{4}$ odd as well. But then $a_{3}^{2}+1$ is a product of two even numbers $\\left(a_{2}+1\\right)\\left(a_{4}+1\\right)$ and thus is divisible by 4 , which is a contradiction as for odd $a_{3}$ we have $a_{3}^{2}+1 \\equiv 2 \\bmod 4$.\n\nHence $a_{2}$ is even. Furthermore $a_{3}+1$ divides the odd number $a_{2}^{2}+1$ and so $a_{3}$ is even. Similarly, $a_{4}$ and $a_{5}$ are even as well.\n\nNow set $x=a_{2}$ and $y=a_{3}$. From the given condition we get $(x+1) \\mid\\left(y^{2}+1\\right)$ and $(y+1) \\mid\\left(x^{2}+1\\right)$. We will prove that there is no pair of positive even numbers $(x, y)$ satisfying these two conditions, thus yielding a contradiction to the assumption.\n\nAssume there exists a pair $\\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\\right)$ of positive even numbers satisfying the two conditions $\\left(x_{0}+1\\right) \\mid\\left(y_{0}^{2}+1\\right)$ and $\\left(y_{0}+1\\right) \\mid\\left(x_{0}^{2}+1\\right)$.\n\nThen one has $\\left(x_{0}+1\\right) \\mid\\left(y_{0}^{2}+1+x_{0}^{2}-1\\right)$, i.e., $\\left(x_{0}+1\\right) \\mid\\left(x_{0}^{2}+y_{0}^{2}\\right)$, and similarly $\\left(y_{0}+1\\right) \\mid\\left(x_{0}^{2}+y_{0}^{2}\\right)$. Any common divisor $d$ of $x_{0}+1$ and $y_{0}+1$ must hence also divide the number $\\left(x_{0}^{2}+1\\right)+\\left(y_{0}^{2}+1\\right)-\\left(x_{0}^{2}+y_{0}^{2}\\right)=2$. But as $x_{0}+1$ and $y_{0}+1$ are both odd, we must have $d=1$. Thus $x_{0}+1$ and $y_{0}+1$ are relatively prime and therefore there exists a positive integer $k$ such that\n\n$$\nk(x+1)(y+1)=x^{2}+y^{2}\n$$\n\nhas the solution $\\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\\right)$. We will show that the latter equation has no solution $(x, y)$ in positive even numbers.\n\nAssume there is a solution. Pick the solution $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ with the smallest sum $x_{1}+y_{1}$ and assume $x_{1} \\geq y_{1}$. Then $x_{1}$ is a solution to the quadratic equation\n\n$$\nx^{2}-k\\left(y_{1}+1\\right) x+y_{1}^{2}-k\\left(y_{1}+1\\right)=0 \\text {. }\n$$\n\n\n\nLet $x_{2}$ be the second solution, which by VIETA's theorem fulfills $x_{1}+x_{2}=k\\left(y_{1}+1\\right)$ and $x_{1} x_{2}=y_{1}^{2}-k\\left(y_{1}+1\\right)$. If $x_{2}=0$, the second equation implies $y_{1}^{2}=k\\left(y_{1}+1\\right)$, which is impossible, as $y_{1}+1>1$ cannot divide the relatively prime number $y_{1}^{2}$. Therefore $x_{2} \\neq 0$.\n\nAlso we get $\\left(x_{1}+1\\right)\\left(x_{2}+1\\right)=x_{1} x_{2}+x_{1}+x_{2}+1=y_{1}^{2}+1$ which is odd, and hence $x_{2}$ must be even and positive. Also we have $x_{2}+1=\\frac{y_{1}^{2}+1}{x_{1}+1} \\leq \\frac{y_{1}^{2}+1}{y_{1}+1} \\leq y_{1} \\leq x_{1}$. But this means that the pair $\\left(x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}\\right)$ with $x^{\\prime}=y_{1}$ and $y^{\\prime}=x_{2}$ is another solution of $k(x+1)(y+1)=x^{2}+y^{2}$ in even positive numbers with $x^{\\prime}+y^{\\prime}<x_{1}+y_{1}$, a contradiction.\n\nTherefore we must have $n \\leq 4$.\n\nWhen $n=4$, a possible example of a sequence is $a_{1}=4, a_{2}=33, a_{3}=217$ and $a_{4}=1384$.",
            "It is easy to check that for $n=4$ the sequence $a_{1}=4, a_{2}=33, a_{3}=217$ and $a_{4}=1384$ is possible.\n\nNow assume there is a sequence with $n \\geq 5$.

Thus $a_{3}$ and hence also $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{4}$ and $a_{5}$ are even. According to (1), one has $a_{1}<a_{2}<a_{3}<a_{4}<a_{5}$ or $a_{1}>a_{2}>a_{3}>a_{4}>a_{5}$ but due to the minimality of $a_{1}$ the first series of inequalities must hold.\n\nConsider the identity\n\n$\\left(a_{3}+1\\right)\\left(a_{1}+a_{3}\\right)=a_{3}^{2}-1+\\left(a_{1}+1\\right)\\left(a_{3}+1\\right)=a_{2}^{2}+a_{3}^{2}=a_{2}^{2}-1+\\left(a_{2}+1\\right)\\left(a_{4}+1\\right)=\\left(a_{2}+1\\right)\\left(a_{2}+a_{4}\\right)$.\n\nAny common divisor of the two odd numbers $a_{2}+1$ and $a_{3}+1$ must also divide $\\left(a_{2}+1\\right)\\left(a_{4}+\\right.$ $1)-\\left(a_{3}+1\\right)\\left(a_{3}-1\\right)=2$, so these numbers are relatively prime. Hence the last identity shows that $a_{1}+a_{3}$ must be a multiple of $a_{2}+1$, i.e. there is an integer $k$ such that\n\n$$\na_{1}+a_{3}=k\\left(a_{2}+1\\right) .\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nNow set $a_{0}=k\\left(a_{1}+1\\right)-a_{2}$. This is an integer and we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(a_{0}+1\\right)\\left(a_{2}+1\\right) & =k\\left(a_{1}+1\\right)\\left(a_{2}+1\\right)-\\left(a_{2}-1\\right)\\left(a_{2}+1\\right) \\\\\n& =\\left(a_{1}+1\\right)\\left(a_{1}+a_{3}\\right)-\\left(a_{1}+1\\right)\\left(a_{3}+1\\right)+2 \\\\\n& =\\left(a_{1}+1\\right)\\left(a_{1}-1\\right)+2=a_{1}^{2}+1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\n\nThus $a_{0} \\geq 0$. If $a_{0}>0$, then by (1) we would have $a_{0}<a_{1}<a_{2}$ and then the quintuple $\\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}\\right)$ would contradict the minimality of $a_{1}$.\n\nHence $a_{0}=0$, implying $a_{2}=a_{1}^{2}$. But also $a_{2}=k\\left(a_{1}+1\\right)$, which finally contradicts the fact that $a_{1}+1>1$ is relatively prime to $a_{1}^{2}$ and thus cannot be a divisior of this number.\n\nHence $n \\geq 5$ is not possible."

        "solution": [
            "The maximum number of such boxes is 6 . One example is shown in the figure.\n\n<img_3912>\n\nNow we show that 6 is the maximum. Suppose that boxes $B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{n}$ satisfy the condition. Let the closed intervals $I_{k}$ and $J_{k}$ be the projections of $B_{k}$ onto the $x$ - and $y$-axis, for $1 \\leq k \\leq n$.\n\nIf $B_{i}$ and $B_{j}$ intersect, with a common point $(x, y)$, then $x \\in I_{i} \\cap I_{j}$ and $y \\in J_{i} \\cap J_{j}$. So the intersections $I_{i} \\cap I_{j}$ and $J_{i} \\cap J_{j}$ are nonempty. Conversely, if $x \\in I_{i} \\cap I_{j}$ and $y \\in J_{i} \\cap J_{j}$ for some real numbers $x, y$, then $(x, y)$ is a common point of $B_{i}$ and $B_{j}$. Putting it around, $B_{i}$ and $B_{j}$ are disjoint if and only if their projections on at least one coordinate axis are disjoint.\n\nFor brevity we call two boxes or intervals adjacent if their indices differ by 1 modulo $n$, and nonadjacent otherwise.\n\nThe adjacent boxes $B_{k}$ and $B_{k+1}$ do not intersect for each $k=1, \\ldots, n$. Hence $\\left(I_{k}, I_{k+1}\\right)$ or $\\left(J_{k}, J_{k+1}\\right)$ is a pair of disjoint intervals, $1 \\leq k \\leq n$. So there are at least $n$ pairs of disjoint intervals among $\\left(I_{1}, I_{2}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(I_{n-1}, I_{n}\\right),\\left(I_{n}, I_{1}\\right) ;\\left(J_{1}, J_{2}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(J_{n-1}, J_{n}\\right),\\left(J_{n}, J_{1}\\right)$.\n\nNext, every two nonadjacent boxes intersect, hence their projections on both axes intersect, too. Then the claim below shows that at most 3 pairs among $\\left(I_{1}, I_{2}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(I_{n-1}, I_{n}\\right),\\left(I_{n}, I_{1}\\right)$ are disjoint, and the same holds for $\\left(J_{1}, J_{2}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(J_{n-1}, J_{n}\\right),\\left(J_{n}, J_{1}\\right)$. Consequently $n \\leq 3+3=6$, as stated. Thus we are left with the claim and its justification.\n\nClaim. Let $\\Delta_{1}, \\Delta_{2}, \\ldots, \\Delta_{n}$ be intervals on a straight line such that every two nonadjacent intervals intersect. Then $\\Delta_{k}$ and $\\Delta_{k+1}$ are disjoint for at most three values of $k=1, \\ldots, n$.\n\nProof. Denote $\\Delta_{k}=\\left[a_{k}, b_{k}\\right], 1 \\leq k \\leq n$. Let $\\alpha=\\max \\left(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right)$ be the rightmost among the left endpoints of $\\Delta_{1}, \\ldots, \\Delta_{n}$, and let $\\beta=\\min \\left(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right)$ be the leftmost among their right endpoints. Assume that $\\alpha=a_{2}$ without loss of generality.\n\nIf $\\alpha \\leq \\beta$ then $a_{i} \\leq \\alpha \\leq \\beta \\leq b_{i}$ for all $i$. Every $\\Delta_{i}$ contains $\\alpha$, and thus no disjoint pair $\\left(\\Delta_{i}, \\Delta_{i+1}\\right)$ exists.\n\n\n\nIf $\\beta<\\alpha$ then $\\beta=b_{i}$ for some $i$ such that $a_{i}<b_{i}=\\beta<\\alpha=a_{2}<b_{2}$, hence $\\Delta_{2}$ and $\\Delta_{i}$ are disjoint. Now $\\Delta_{2}$ intersects all remaining intervals except possibly $\\Delta_{1}$ and $\\Delta_{3}$, so $\\Delta_{2}$ and $\\Delta_{i}$ can be disjoint only if $i=1$ or $i=3$. Suppose by symmetry that $i=3$; then $\\beta=b_{3}$. Since each of the intervals $\\Delta_{4}, \\ldots, \\Delta_{n}$ intersects $\\Delta_{2}$, we have $a_{i} \\leq \\alpha \\leq b_{i}$ for $i=4, \\ldots, n$. Therefore $\\alpha \\in \\Delta_{4} \\cap \\ldots \\cap \\Delta_{n}$, in particular $\\Delta_{4} \\cap \\ldots \\cap \\Delta_{n} \\neq \\emptyset$. Similarly, $\\Delta_{5}, \\ldots, \\Delta_{n}, \\Delta_{1}$ all intersect $\\Delta_{3}$, so that $\\Delta_{5} \\cap \\ldots \\cap \\Delta_{n} \\cap \\Delta_{1} \\neq \\emptyset$ as $\\beta \\in \\Delta_{5} \\cap \\ldots \\cap \\Delta_{n} \\cap \\Delta_{1}$. This leaves $\\left(\\Delta_{1}, \\Delta_{2}\\right),\\left(\\Delta_{2}, \\Delta_{3}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\Delta_{3}, \\Delta_{4}\\right)$ as the only candidates for disjoint interval pairs, as desired."

A set $T \\subset S$ will be called a $k$-clique if every two points in $T$ are $k$-friends. Find the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a $k$-clique with more than 200 elements.",
        "solution": [
            "To begin, let us describe those points $B \\in S$ which are $k$-friends of the point $(0,0)$. By definition, $B=(u, v)$ satisfies this condition if and only if there is a point $C=(x, y) \\in S$ such that $\\frac{1}{2}|u y-v x|=k$. (This is a well-known formula expressing the area of triangle $A B C$ when $A$ is the origin.)\n\nTo say that there exist integers $x, y$ for which $|u y-v x|=2 k$, is equivalent to saying that the greatest common divisor of $u$ and $v$ is also a divisor of $2 k$. Summing up, a point $B=(u, v) \\in S$ is a $k$-friend of $(0,0)$ if and only if $\\operatorname{gcd}(u, v)$ divides $2 k$.\n\nTranslation by a vector with integer coordinates does not affect $k$-friendship; if two points are $k$-friends, so are their translates. It follows that two points $A, B \\in S, A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$, are $k$-friends if and only if the point $(u-s, v-t)$ is a $k$-friend of $(0,0)$; i.e., if $\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t) \\mid 2 k$.\n\nLet $n$ be a positive integer which does not divide $2 k$. We claim that a $k$-clique cannot have more than $n^{2}$ elements.\n\nIndeed, all points $(x, y) \\in S$ can be divided into $n^{2}$ classes determined by the remainders that $x$ and $y$ leave in division by $n$. If a set $T$ has more than $n^{2}$ elements, some two points $A, B \\in T, A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$, necessarily fall into the same class. This means that $n \\mid u-s$ and $n \\mid v-t$. Hence $n \\mid d$ where $d=\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t)$. And since $n$ does not divide $2 k$, also $d$ does not divide $2 k$. Thus $A$ and $B$ are not $k$-friends and the set $T$ is not a $k$-clique.\n\nNow let $M(k)$ be the least positive integer which does not divide $2 k$. Write $M(k)=m$ for the moment and consider the set $T$ of all points $(x, y)$ with $0 \\leq x, y<m$. There are $m^{2}$ of them. If $A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$ are two distinct points in $T$ then both differences $|u-s|,|v-t|$ are integers less than $m$ and at least one of them is positive. By the definition of $m$, every positive integer less than $m$ divides $2 k$. Therefore $u-s$ (if nonzero) divides $2 k$, and the same is true of $v-t$. So $2 k$ is divisible by $\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t)$, meaning that $A, B$ are $k$-friends. Thus $T$ is a $k$-clique.\n\nIt follows that the maximum size of a $k$-clique is $M(k)^{2}$, with $M(k)$ defined as above. We are looking for the minimum $k$ such that $M(k)^{2}>200$.\n\nBy the definition of $M(k), 2 k$ is divisible by the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, M(k)-1$, but not by $M(k)$ itself. If $M(k)^{2}>200$ then $M(k) \\geq 15$. Trying to hit $M(k)=15$ we get a contradiction immediately ( $2 k$ would have to be divisible by 3 and 5 , but not by 15 ).\n\nSo let us try $M(k)=16$. Then $2 k$ is divisible by the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, 15$, hence also by their least common multiple $L$, but not by 16 . And since $L$ is not a multiple of 16 , we infer that $k=L / 2$ is the least $k$ with $M(k)=16$.\n\nFinally, observe that if $M(k) \\geq 17$ then $2 k$ must be divisible by the least common multiple of $1,2, \\ldots, 16$, which is equal to $2 L$. Then $2 k \\geq 2 L$, yielding $k>L / 2$.\n\nIn conclusion, the least $k$ with the required property is equal to $L / 2=180180$."

            "A sequence of $k$ switches ending in the state as described in the problem statement (lamps $1, \\ldots, n$ on, lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ off) will be called an admissible process. If, moreover, the process does not touch the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$, it will be called restricted. So there are $N$ admissible processes, among which $M$ are restricted.\n\nIn every admissible process, restricted or not, each one of the lamps $1, \\ldots, n$ goes from off to on, so it is switched an odd number of times; and each one of the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ goes from off to off, so it is switched an even number of times.\n\nNotice that $M>0$; i.e., restricted admissible processes do exist (it suffices to switch each one of the lamps $1, \\ldots, n$ just once and then choose one of them and switch it $k-n$ times, which by hypothesis is an even number).\n\nConsider any restricted admissible process $\\mathbf{p}$. Take any lamp $\\ell, 1 \\leq \\ell \\leq n$, and suppose that it was switched $k_{\\ell}$ times. As noticed, $k_{\\ell}$ must be odd. Select arbitrarily an even number of these $k_{\\ell}$ switches and replace each of them by the switch of lamp $n+\\ell$. This can be done in $2^{k_{\\ell}-1}$ ways (because a $k_{\\ell}$-element set has $2^{k_{\\ell}-1}$ subsets of even cardinality). Notice that $k_{1}+\\cdots+k_{n}=k$.\n\nThese actions are independent, in the sense that the action involving lamp $\\ell$ does not affect the action involving any other lamp. So there are $2^{k_{1}-1} \\cdot 2^{k_{2}-1} \\cdots 2^{k_{n}-1}=2^{k-n}$ ways of combining these actions. In any of these combinations, each one of the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ gets switched an even number of times and each one of the lamps $1, \\ldots, n$ remains switched an odd number of times, so the final state is the same as that resulting from the original process $\\mathbf{p}$.\n\nThis shows that every restricted admissible process $\\mathbf{p}$ can be modified in $2^{k-n}$ ways, giving rise to $2^{k-n}$ distinct admissible processes (with all lamps allowed).\n\nNow we show that every admissible process $\\mathbf{q}$ can be achieved in that way. Indeed, it is enough to replace every switch of a lamp with a label $\\ell>n$ that occurs in $\\mathbf{q}$ by the switch of the corresponding lamp $\\ell-n$; in the resulting process $\\mathbf{p}$ the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ are not involved.\n\nSwitches of each lamp with a label $\\ell>n$ had occurred in $\\mathbf{q}$ an even number of times. So the performed replacements have affected each lamp with a label $\\ell \\leq n$ also an even number of times; hence in the overall effect the final state of each lamp has remained the same. This means that the resulting process $\\mathbf{p}$ is admissible - and clearly restricted, as the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ are not involved in it any more.\n\nIf we now take process $\\mathbf{p}$ and reverse all these replacements, then we obtain process $\\mathbf{q}$. These reversed replacements are nothing else than the modifications described in the foregoing paragraphs.\n\nThus there is a one-to- $\\left(2^{k-n}\\right)$ correspondence between the $M$ restricted admissible processes and the total of $N$ admissible processes. Therefore $N / M=2^{k-n}$."

            "The only solution is the function $f(x)=x-1, x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nWe set $g(x)=f(x)+1$ and show that $g(x)=x$ for all real $x$. The conditions take the form\n\n$$\ng(1+x y)-g(x+y)=(g(x)-1)(g(y)-1) \\quad \\text { for all } x, y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\text { and } g(-1) \\neq 1\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nDenote $C=g(-1)-1 \\neq 0$. Setting $y=-1$ in (1) gives\n\n$$\ng(1-x)-g(x-1)=C(g(x)-1) .\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nSet $x=1$ in $(2)$ to obtain $C(g(1)-1)=0$. Hence $g(1)=1$ as $C \\neq 0$. Now plugging in $x=0$ and $x=2$ yields $g(0)=0$ and $g(2)=2$ respectively.\n\nWe pass on to the key observations\n\n$$\ng(x)+g(2-x)=2 \\text { for all } x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\tag{3}\n$$\n\n$$\ng(x+2)-g(x)=2 \\text { for all } x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\tag{4}\n$$\n\nReplace $x$ by $1-x$ in (2), then change $x$ to $-x$ in the resulting equation. We obtain the relations $g(x)-g(-x)=C(g(1-x)-1), g(-x)-g(x)=C(g(1+x)-1)$. Then adding them up leads to $C(g(1-x)+g(1+x)-2)=0$. Thus $C \\neq 0$ implies (3).\n\nLet $u, v$ be such that $u+v=1$. Apply (1) to the pairs $(u, v)$ and $(2-u, 2-v)$ :\n\n$$\ng(1+u v)-g(1)=(g(u)-1)(g(v)-1), \\quad g(3+u v)-g(3)=(g(2-u)-1)(g(2-v)-1) .\n$$\n\nObserve that the last two equations have equal right-hand sides by (3). Hence $u+v=1$ implies\n\n$$\ng(u v+3)-g(u v+1)=g(3)-g(1)\n$$\n\nEach $x \\leq 5 / 4$ is expressible in the form $x=u v+1$ with $u+v=1$ (the quadratic function $t^{2}-t+(x-1)$ has real roots for $\\left.x \\leq 5 / 4\\right)$. Hence $g(x+2)-g(x)=g(3)-g(1)$ whenever $x \\leq 5 / 4$. Because $g(x)=x$ holds for $x=0,1,2$, setting $x=0$ yields $g(3)=3$. This proves (4) for $x \\leq 5 / 4$. If $x>5 / 4$ then $-x<5 / 4$ and so $g(2-x)-g(-x)=2$ by the above. On the other hand (3) gives $g(x)=2-g(2-x), g(x+2)=2-g(-x)$, so that $g(x+2)-g(x)=g(2-x)-g(-x)=2$. Thus (4) is true for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNow replace $x$ by $-x$ in (3) to obtain $g(-x)+g(2+x)=2$. In view of (4) this leads to $g(x)+g(-x)=0$, i. e. $g(-x)=-g(x)$ for all $x$. Taking this into account, we apply (1) to the pairs $(-x, y)$ and $(x,-y)$ :\n\n$g(1-x y)-g(-x+y)=(g(x)+1)(1-g(y)), \\quad g(1-x y)-g(x-y)=(1-g(x))(g(y)+1)$.\n\nAdding up yields $g(1-x y)=1-g(x) g(y)$. Then $g(1+x y)=1+g(x) g(y)$ by (3). Now the original equation (1) takes the form $g(x+y)=g(x)+g(y)$. Hence $g$ is additive.\n\nBy additvity $g(1+x y)=g(1)+g(x y)=1+g(x y)$; since $g(1+x y)=1+g(x) g(y)$ was shown above, we also have $g(x y)=g(x) g(y)$ ( $g$ is multiplicative). In particular $y=x$ gives $g\\left(x^{2}\\right)=g(x)^{2} \\geq 0$ for all $x$, meaning that $g(x) \\geq 0$ for $x \\geq 0$. Since $g$ is additive and bounded from below on $[0,+\\infty)$, it is linear; more exactly $g(x)=g(1) x=x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nIn summary $f(x)=x-1, x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. It is straightforward that this function satisfies the requirements."

In these cases the required number $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{2 n-1}{5}\\right\\rfloor$ of pairs equals $2 k+1$ again, and the numbers in the table do not exceed $5 k+3$. In the case $n=5 k+2$ with $k \\geq 0$ one needs only $2 k$ pairs. They can be obtained by ignoring the last column of the table (thus removing $5 k+3$ ). Finally, $2 k$ pairs are also needed for the case $n=5 k+1$ with $k \\geq 0$. Now it suffices to ignore the last column of the table and then subtract 1 from each number in the first row."

She passes every chosen coin to an adjacent box.\n\nPlayer $A$ 's goal is to ensure at least 1 coin in each box after every move of hers, regardless of how $B$ plays and how many moves are made. Find the least $N$ that enables her to succeed.",
        "solution": [
            "We argue for a general $n \\geq 7$ instead of 2012 and prove that the required minimum $N$ is $2 n-2$. For $n=2012$ this gives $N_{\\min }=4022$.\n\na) If $N=2 n-2$ player $A$ can achieve her goal. Let her start the game with a regular distribution: $n-2$ boxes with 2 coins and 2 boxes with 1 coin. Call the boxes of the two kinds red and white respectively. We claim that on her first move $A$ can achieve a regular distribution again, regardless of $B$ 's first move $M$. She acts according as the following situation $S$ occurs after $M$ or not: The initial distribution contains a red box $R$ with 2 white neighbors, and $R$ receives no coins from them on move $M$.\n\nSuppose that $S$ does not occur. Exactly one of the coins $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ in a given red box $X$ is involved in $M$, say $c_{1}$. If $M$ passes $c_{1}$ to the right neighbor of $X$, let $A$ pass $c_{2}$ to its left neighbor, and vice versa. By doing so with all red boxes $A$ performs a legal move $M^{\\prime}$. Thus $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$ combined move the 2 coins of every red box in opposite directions. Hence after $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$ are complete each neighbor of a red box $X$ contains exactly 1 coin that was initially in $X$. So each box with a red neighbor is non-empty after $M^{\\prime}$. If initially there is a box $X$ with 2 white neighbors ( $X$ is red and unique) then $X$ receives a coin from at least one of them on move $M$ since $S$ does not occur. Such a coin is not involved in $M^{\\prime}$, so $X$ is also non-empty after $M^{\\prime}$. Furthermore each box $Y$ has given away its initial content after $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$. A red neighbor of $Y$ adds 1 coin to it; a white neighbor adds at most 1 coin because it is not involved in $M^{\\prime}$. Hence each box contains 1 or 2 coins after $M^{\\prime}$. Because $N=2 n-2$, such a distribution is regular.\n\nNow let $S$ occur after move $M$. Then $A$ leaves untouched the exceptional red box $R$. With all remaining red boxes she proceeds like in the previous case, thus making a legal move $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Box $R$ receives no coins from its neighbors on either move, so there is 1 coin in it after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Like above $M$ and $M^{\\prime \\prime}$ combined pass exactly 1 coin from every red box different from $R$ to each of its neighbors. Every box except $R$ has a red neighbor different from $R$, hence all boxes are non-empty after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Next, each box $Y$ except $R$ loses its initial content after $M$ and $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. A red neighbor of $Y$ adds at most 1 coin to it; a white neighbor also adds at most 1 coin as it does not participate in $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Thus each box has 1 or 2 coins after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$, and the obtained distribution is regular.\n\nPlayer $A$ can apply the described strategy indefinitely, so $N=2 n-2$ enables her to succeed.\n\nb) For $N \\leq 2 n-3$ player $B$ can achieve an empty box after some move of $A$. Let $\\alpha$ be a set of $\\ell$ consecutive boxes containing a total of $N(\\alpha)$ coins. We call $\\alpha$ an $\\operatorname{arc}$ if $\\ell \\leq n-2$ and $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$. Note that $\\ell \\geq 2$ by the last condition. Moreover if both extremes of $\\alpha$ are non-empty boxes then $N(\\alpha) \\geq 2$, so that $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$ implies $\\ell \\geq 3$. Observe also that if an extreme $X$ of $\\alpha$ has more than 1 coin then ignoring $X$ yields a shorter arc. It follows that every arc contains an arc whose extremes have at most 1 coin each.\n\nGiven a clockwise labeling $1,2, \\ldots, n$ of the boxes, suppose that boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ form an arc $\\alpha$, with $\\ell \\leq n-2$ and $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$. Suppose also that all $n \\geq 7$ boxes are non-empty. Then $B$ can move so that an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$ will appear after any response of $A$.\n\n\n\nOne may assume exactly 1 coin in boxes 1 and $\\ell$ by a previous remark. Let $B$ pass 1 coin in counterclockwise direction from box 1 and box $n$, and in clockwise direction from each remaining box. This leaves $N(\\alpha)-2$ coins in the boxes of $\\alpha$. In addition, due to $3 \\leq \\ell \\leq n-2$, box $\\ell$ has exactly 1 coin $c$, the one received from box $\\ell-1$.\n\nLet player $A$ 's next move $M$ pass $k \\leq 2$ coins to boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ from the remaining ones. Only boxes 1 and $\\ell$ can receive such coins, at most 1 each. If $k<2$ then after move $M$ boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ form an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$. If $k=2$ then $M$ adds a coin to box $\\ell$. Also $M$ does not move coin $c$ from $\\ell$ because $c$ is involved in the previous move of $B$. In summary boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ contain $N(\\alpha)$ coins like before, so they form an arc. However there are 2 coins now in the extreme $\\ell$ of the arc. Ignore $\\ell$ to obtain a shorter arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$.\n\nConsider any initial distribution without empty boxes. Since $N \\leq 2 n-3$, there are at least 3 boxes in it with exactly 1 coin. It follows from $n \\geq 7$ that some 2 of them are the extremes of an arc $\\alpha$. Hence $B$ can make the move described above, which leads to an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$ after $A^{\\prime}$ 's response. If all boxes in the new distribution are non-empty he can repeat the same, and so on. Because $N(\\alpha)$ cannot decrease indefinitely, an empty box will occur after some move of $A$."

            "First note that $x$ divides $2012 \\cdot 2=2^{3} \\cdot 503$. If $503 \\mid x$ then the right-hand side of the equation is divisible by $503^{3}$, and it follows that $503^{2} \\mid x y z+2$. This is false as $503 \\mid x$. Hence $x=2^{m}$ with $m \\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}$. If $m \\geq 2$ then $2^{6} \\mid 2012(x y z+2)$. However the highest powers of 2 dividing 2012 and $x y z+2=2^{m} y z+2$ are $2^{2}$ and $2^{1}$ respectively. So $x=1$ or $x=2$, yielding the two equations\n\n$$\ny^{3}+z^{3}=2012(y z+2), \\quad \\text { and } \\quad y^{3}+z^{3}=503(y z+1)\n$$\n\nIn both cases the prime $503=3 \\cdot 167+2$ divides $y^{3}+z^{3}$. We claim that $503 \\mid y+z$. This is clear if $503 \\mid y$, so let $503 \\nmid y$ and $503 \\nmid z$. Then $y^{502} \\equiv z^{502}(\\bmod 503)$ by FERMAT's little theorem. On the other hand $y^{3} \\equiv-z^{3}(\\bmod 503)$ implies $y^{3 \\cdot 167} \\equiv-z^{3 \\cdot 167}(\\bmod 503)$, i. e. $y^{501} \\equiv-z^{501}(\\bmod 503)$. It follows that $y \\equiv-z(\\bmod 503)$ as claimed.\n\nTherefore $y+z=503 k$ with $k \\geq 1$. In view of $y^{3}+z^{3}=(y+z)\\left((y-z)^{2}+y z\\right)$ the two equations take the form\n\n$$\nk(y-z)^{2}+(k-4) y z=8 \\tag{1}\n$$\n$$\nk(y-z)^{2}+(k-1) y z=1 \\tag{2}\n$$\n\nIn (1) we have $(k-4) y z \\leq 8$, which implies $k \\leq 4$. Indeed if $k>4$ then $1 \\leq(k-4) y z \\leq 8$, so that $y \\leq 8$ and $z \\leq 8$. This is impossible as $y+z=503 k \\geq 503$. Note next that $y^{3}+z^{3}$ is even in the first equation. Hence $y+z=503 k$ is even too, meaning that $k$ is even. Thus $k=2$ or $k=4$. Clearly (1) has no integer solutions for $k=4$. If $k=2$ then (1) takes the form $(y+z)^{2}-5 y z=4$. Since $y+z=503 k=503 \\cdot 2$, this leads to $5 y z=503^{2} \\cdot 2^{2}-4$. However $503^{2} \\cdot 2^{2}-4$ is not a multiple of 5 . Therefore (1) has no integer solutions.\n\nEquation (2) implies $0 \\leq(k-1) y z \\leq 1$, so that $k=1$ or $k=2$. Also $0 \\leq k(y-z)^{2} \\leq 1$, hence $k=2$ only if $y=z$. However then $y=z=1$, which is false in view of $y+z \\geq 503$. Therefore $k=1$ and (2) takes the form $(y-z)^{2}=1$, yielding $z-y=|y-z|=1$. Combined with $k=1$ and $y+z=503 k$, this leads to $y=251, z=252$.\n\nIn summary the triple $(2,251,252)$ is the only solution."

Therefore, for any rational number $x=\\frac{p}{q}$ we have,\n\n$$\nf(x)=f\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right)=f\\left(p \\cdot \\frac{1}{q}\\right)=p \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{1}{p}\\right)=p \\cdot \\frac{f\\left(q \\cdot \\frac{1}{q}\\right)}{q}=\\frac{p}{q} \\cdot f(1)=x f(1)\n$$\n\nSo, we have $f(x)=k x$, for some rational number $k$. Let's put this answer in (1) and we get $k(x k x+y)=k y+x^{2}$, thus $k^{2}=1$. Therefore $f(x)=x$ and $f(x)=-x$ are solutions."

            "The answer is $k=3$.\n\nFirst we show that there is such a function and coloring for $k=3$. Consider $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ given by $f(n)=n$ for all $n \\equiv 1$ or 2 modulo 3 , and $f(n)=2 n$ for $n \\equiv 0$ modulo 3 . Moreover, give a positive integer $n$ the $i$-th color if $n \\equiv i(3)$.\n\nBy construction we have $f(1+2)=6 \\neq 3=f(1)+f(2)$ and hence $f$ has property (ii).\n\nNow let $n, m$ be positive integers with the same color $i$. If $i=0$, then $n+m$ has color 0 , so $f(n+m)=$ $2(n+m)=2 n+2 m=f(n)+f(m)$. If $i=1$, then $n+m$ has color 2 , so $f(n+m)=n+m=f(n)+f(m)$. Finally, if $i=2$, then $n+m$ has color 1 , so $f(n+m)=n+m=f(n)+f(m)$. Therefore $f$ also satisfies condition (i).\n\nNext we show that there is no such function and coloring for $k=2$.\n\nConsider any coloring of $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with 2 colors and any function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ satisfying conditions (i) and (ii). Then there exist positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that $f(m+n) \\neq f(m)+f(n)$. Choose $m$ and $n$ such that their sum is minimal among all such $m, n$ and define $a=m+n$. Then in particular for every $b<a$ we have $f(b)=b f(1)$ and $f(a) \\neq a f(1)$.\n\nIf $a$ is even, then condition (i) for $m=n=\\frac{a}{2}$ implies $f(a)=f\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)+f\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)=f(1) a$, a contradiction. Hence $a$ is odd. We will prove two lemmas.\n\nLemma 1. Any odd integer $b<a$ has a different color than $a$.\n\nProof. Suppose that $b<a$ is an odd integer, and that $a$ and $b$ have the same color. Then on the one hand, $f(a+b)=f(a)+b f(1)$. On the other hand, we also have $f(a+b)=f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)+f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)=(a+b) f(1)$, as $\\frac{a+b}{2}$ is a positive integer smaller than $a$. Hence $f(a)=f(a+b)-b f(1)=(a+b) f(1)-b f(1)=a f(1)$, which is again a contradiction. Therefore all odd integers smaller than $a$ have a color different from that of $a$.\n\nLemma 2. Any even integer $b<a$ has the same color as a\n\nProof. Suppose $b<a$ is an even integer, and that $a$ and $b$ have different colors. Then $a-b$ is an odd integer smaller than $a$, so it has the same color as $b$. Thus $f(a)=f(a-b)+f(b)=(a-b) f(1)+b f(1)=a f(1)$, a contradiction. Hence all even integers smaller than $a$ have the same color as $a$.\n\nSuppose now $a+1$ has the same color as $a$. As $a>1$, we have $\\frac{a+1}{2}<a$ and therefore $f(a+1)=2 f\\left(\\frac{a+1}{2}\\right)=$ $(a+1) f(1)$. As $a-1$ is an even integer smaller than $a$, we have by Lemma 2 that $a-1$ also has the same color as $a$. Hence $2 f(a)=f(2 a)=f(a+1)+f(a-1)=(a+1) f(1)+(a-1) f(1)=2 a f(1)$, which implies that $f(a)=a f(1)$, a contradiction. So $a$ and $a+1$ have different colors.\n\nSince $a-2$ is an odd integer smaller than $a$, by Lemma 1 it has a color different from that of $a$, so $a-2$ and $a+1$ have the same color. Also, we have seen by Lemma 2 that $a-1$ and $a$ have the same color. So $f(a)+f(a-1)=f(2 a-1)=f(a+1)+f(a-2)=(a+1) f(1)+(a-2) f(1)=(2 a-1) f(1)$, from which it follows that $f(a)=(2 a-1) f(1)-f(a-1)=(2 a-1) f(1)-(a-1) f(1)=a f(1)$, which contradicts our choice of $a$ and finishes the proof.",
            "We prove that $k \\leq 3$ just as in first solution.\n\nNext we show that there is no such function and coloring for $k=2$.\n\nConsider any coloring of $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with 2 colors and any function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ satisfying conditions (i) and (ii). We first notice with $m=n$ that $f(2 n)=2 f(n)$.\n\nLemma 3. For every $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}, f(3 n)=3 f(n)$ holds.\n\nProof. Define $c=f(n), d=f(3 n)$. Then we have the relations\n\n$$\nf(2 n)=2 c, \\quad f(4 n)=4 c, \\quad f(6 n)=2 d\n$$\n\n- If $n$ and $2 n$ have the same color, then $f(3 n)=f(n)+f(2 n)=3 c=3 f(n)$.\n- If $n$ and $3 n$ have the same color, then $4 c=f(4 n)=f(n)+f(3 n)=c+f(3 n)$, so $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n- If $2 n$ and $4 n$ have the same color, then $2 d=f(6 n)=f(2 n)+f(4 n)=2 c+4 c=6 c$, so $f(3 n)=d=3 c$.\n- Otherwise $n$ and $4 n$ have the same color, and $2 n$ and $3 n$ both have the opposite color to $n$. Therefore we compute $5 c=f(n)+f(4 n)=f(5 n)=f(2 n)+f(3 n)=2 c+f(3 n)$ so $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n\nConsequently, for $k=2$ we necessarily have $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n\nNow let $a$ be the smallest integer such that $f(a) \\neq a f(1)$.

It is clearly true for $l=0$. If $x+l m$ is black and satisfies $f(x+l m)=$ $f(x)+l f(m)$, then $f(x+(l+1) m)=f(x+l m)+f(m)=f(x)+(l+1) f(m)$ and $f(x+(l+1) m+n)=$ $f(x+l m)+f(m+n)=f(x)+l f(m)+f(m+n) \\neq f(x)+(l+1) f(m)+f(n)=f(x+(l+1) m)+f(n)$, so $x+(l+1) m$ is not the same color of $n$, therefore $x+(l+1) m$ is black. Thjs completes the induction.\n\nIn particular we then must have that $2^{l} n$ is white for every $l$, because otherwise since $2^{l} m$ is black we would have $2^{l} f(m+n)=f\\left(2^{l} m+2^{l} n\\right)=f\\left(2^{l} m\\right)+f\\left(2^{l} n\\right)=2^{l}(f(m)+f(n))$, and consequently $f(m+n)=$ $f(m)+f(n)$.\n\nLemma 5.

Indeed, if a blue cell is alone in its row, respectively column, then there are at least two other blue cells in its column, respectively row, and the claim follows.\n\nSuppose now, if possible, the total number of blue cells is less than $6 \\mathrm{~m}$. We will show that $m_{1}^{r}>m_{3}^{r}$ and $m_{1}^{c}>m_{3}^{c}$, and reach a contradiction by the preceding: $m_{1}^{r}>m_{3}^{r} \\geq m_{1}^{c}>m_{3}^{c} \\geq m_{1}^{r}$.\n\nWe prove the first inequality; the other one is dealt with similarly. To this end, notice that there are no empty rows - otherwise, each column would contain at least two blue cells, whence a total of at least $8 m>6 m$ blue cells, which is a contradiction. Next, count rows to get $m_{1}^{r}+m_{2}^{r} / 2+m_{3}^{r} / 3 \\geq 4 m$, and count blue cells to get $m_{1}^{r}+m_{2}^{r}+m_{3}^{r}<6 m$. Subtraction of the latter from the former multiplied by $3 / 2$ yields $m_{1}^{r}-m_{3}^{r}>m_{2}^{r} / 2 \\geq 0$, and the conclusion follows.",
            "To prove that a minimal configuration of blue cells satisfying the condition in the statement has cardinality at least $6 m$, consider a bipartite graph whose vertex parts are the rows and the columns of the array, respectively, a row and a column being joined by an edge if and only if the two cross at a blue cell. Clearly, the number of blue cells is equal to the number of edges of this graph, and the relationship condition in the statement reads: for every row $r$ and every column $c, \\operatorname{deg} r+\\operatorname{deg} c-\\epsilon(r, c) \\geq 2$, where $\\epsilon(r, c)=2$ if $r$ and $c$ are joined by an edge, and $\\epsilon(r, c)=0$ otherwise.\n\nNotice that there are no empty rows/columns, so the graph has no isolated vertices. By the preceding, the cardinality of every connected component of the graph is at least 4 , so there are at most $2 \\cdot 4 m / 4=2 m$ such and, consequently, the graph has at least $8 m-2 m=6 m$ edges. This completes the proof."

We shall first show that $m-1$ is a power of 3 .\n\nSuppose that $m-1$ is even. Then $a_{4}=5 m-1$ should be divisible by 4 and hence $m \\equiv 1(\\bmod 4)$. But then $a_{5}=5 m^{2}+3 m-1 \\equiv 3(\\bmod 4)$ cannot be a square, a contradiction. Therefore $m-1$ is odd.\n\nSuppose that an odd prime $p \\neq 3$ divides $m-1$. Note that $a_{n}-a_{n-1} \\equiv a_{n-2}-a_{n-3}(\\bmod p)$. It follows that modulo $p$ the sequence takes the form $1,1,4,4,7,7,10,10, \\ldots$; indeed, a simple induction shows that $a_{2 k} \\equiv a_{2 k-1} \\equiv 3 k-2(\\bmod p)$ for $k \\geq 1$. Since $\\operatorname{gcd}(p, 3)=1$ we get that the sequence $a_{n}(\\bmod p)$ contains all the residues modulo $p$, a contradiction since only $(p+1) / 2$ residues modulo $p$ are squares. This shows that $m-1$ is a power of 3 .\n\nLet $h, k$ be integers such that $m=3^{k}+1$ and $a_{4}=h^{2}$. We then have $5 \\cdot 3^{k}=(h-2)(h+2)$.

In both the cases we have $a_{4}=b_{4}^{2}$.\n\nIf $n \\geq 5$ then we have\n\n$$\nb_{n}^{2}+b_{n-3}^{2}=\\left(t b_{n-1}+b_{n-2}\\right)^{2}+\\left(b_{n-1}-t b_{n-2}\\right)^{2}=\\left(t^{2}+1\\right)\\left(b_{n-1}^{2}+b_{n-2}^{2}\\right)=m\\left(b_{n-1}^{2}+b_{n-2}^{2}\\right) .\n$$\n\nTherefore, it follows by induction that $a_{n}=b_{n}^{2}$ for all $n \\geq 1$.

            "The maximal number of euros is $2^{n}-n-1$.\n\nTo begin with, we show that it is possible for the Jury to collect this number of euros. We argue by induction. Let us assume that the Jury can collect $M_{n}$ euros in a configuration with $n$ contestants. Then we show that the Jury can collect at least $2 M_{n}+n$ moves in a configuration with $n+1$ contestants. Indeed, let us begin with all the contestants lined up in reverse order. In the first $M_{n}$ moves the Jury keeps $C_{n+1}$ in first position and reverses the order of the remaining contestants, then in the next $n$ moves all contestants $C_{1}, \\ldots, C_{n}$ (in this order) jump over $C_{n+1}$ and end up in the first $n$ positions of the line in reverse order, and finally in the last $M_{n}$ moves the Jury rearranges the first $n$ positions.\n\nSince $M_{1}=0$ and $M_{n+1} \\geq 2 M_{n}+n$, an easy induction shows that $M_{n} \\geq 2^{n}-n-1$.\n\n<img_3565>\n\nLet us show now that at most $2^{n}-n-1$ moves are possible. To this end, let us identify a line of contestants with a permutation $\\sigma$ of $\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$. To each permutation we associate the set of reverse pairs\n\n$$\nR(\\sigma):=\\{(i, j): 1 \\leq i<j \\leq n \\text { and } \\sigma(i)>\\sigma(j)\\}\n$$\n\nand the nonnegative integer\n\n$$\nW(\\sigma):=\\sum_{(i, j) \\in R(\\sigma)} 2^{i}\n$$\n\nwhich we call the total weight of the permutation. We claim that the total weight decreases after any move of the contestants. Indeed, let us assume that $C_{i}$ moves forward in the queue, let $\\sigma$ be the permutation before the move, and let $\\sigma^{\\prime}$ denote the permutation after the move. Since $C_{i}$ jumps over exactly $i$ contestants, necessarily she jumps over at least one contestant $C_{j}$ with index\n\n\n\n$j>i$. This means that the pair $(i, j)$ is reverse with respect to $\\sigma$ but not with respect to $\\sigma^{\\prime}$, and this yields a reduction of $2^{i}$ in the total weight. On the other hand, the move by $C_{i}$ can create new reverse pairs of the form $(k, i)$ with $k<i$, but their total contribution is at most\n\n$$\n2^{0}+2^{1}+\\ldots+2^{i-1}=2^{i}-1\n$$\n\nIn conclusion, when passing from $\\sigma$ to $\\sigma^{\\prime}$, at least one term $2^{i}$ disappears from the computation of the total weight, and the sum of all the new terms that might have been created is at most $2^{i}-1$. This shows that $W\\left(\\sigma^{\\prime}\\right) \\leq W(\\sigma)-1$.\n\nWe conclude by observing that the maximum possible value of $W(\\sigma)$ is realized when all pairs are reverse, in which case\n\n$$\nW(\\sigma)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(i-1) 2^{i}=2^{n}-n-1\n$$\n\nThis proves that the number of moves is less than or equal to $2^{n}-n-1$, and in particular it is finite."

            "First suppose that $a=0$. Then we have $b c=1$ and $c=b^{2} c=b$. So $b=c$, which implies $b^{2}=1$ and hence $b= \\pm 1$. This leads to the solutions $(a, b, c)=(0,1,1)$ and $(a, b, c)=(0,-1,-1)$. Similarly, $b=0$ gives the solutions $(a, b, c)=(1,0,1)$ and $(a, b, c)=(-1,0,-1)$, while $c=0$ gives $(a, b, c)=(1,1,0)$ and $(a, b, c)=(-1,-1,0)$.\n\nNow we may assume that $a, b, c \\neq=0$. We multiply $a b+b c+c a=1$ by $a$ to find $a^{2} b+a b c+c a^{2}=a$, hence $a^{2} b=a-a b c-a^{2} c$. Substituting this in $a^{2} b+c=b^{2} c+a$ yields $a-a b c-a^{2} c+c=b^{2} c+a$, so $b^{2} c+a b c+a^{2} c=c$.

It is easy to see that if e.g. $a=0$ then $b=c= \\pm 1$, and if e.g. $a=b$ then either $a=b=c= \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$ or $a=b= \\pm 1, c=0$, and these are indeed solutions. So, to show that these are all solutions (up to symmetries), we may assume by contradiction that $a, b, c$ are pairwise different and non-zero. All conditions are preserved under cyclic shifts and under simultaenously switching signs on all $a, b, c$, and by applying these operations as necessary we may assume $a<b<c$. It follows that $D^{3}=a^{2} b^{2} c^{2}(c-b)(a-c)(b-a)$ must be negative (the only negative term is $a-c$, hence $D$ is negative, i.e. $b c, a b<0<a c$. But this means that $a, c$ have the same sign and $b$ has a different one, which clearly contradicts $a<b<c$ ! So, such configurations are impossible.\n\nEnding 2. Note that $3 D=\\sum c^{2} b-\\sum b^{2} c=(c-b)(c-a)(b-a)$ and $D^{3}=a^{2} b^{2} c^{2}(c-$ $b)(a-c)(b-a)=-3 a^{2} b^{2} c^{2} D$. Since $3 D$ and $D^{3}$ must have the same sign, and $-3 a^{2} b^{2} c^{2}$ is non-positive, necessarily $D=0$. Thus (up to cyclic permutation) $a=b$ and from there we immediately find either $a=b= \\pm 1, c=0$ or $a=b=c= \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$."

For each $n$, determine the largest number of dominoes that can be placed in this way.\n\n(A domino is a tile of size $2 \\times 1$ or $1 \\times 2$.

Two cells are said to be adjacent if they are different and share a common side.)",

            "Let $M$ denote the maximum number of dominoes which satisfy the condition of the problem. We claim that $M=n(n+1) / 2$. The proof naturally splits into two parts: we first prove that $n(n+1) / 2$ dominoes can be placed on the board, and then show that $M \\leq n(n+1) / 2$ to complete the proof. To prove that $M \\leq$ $n(n+1) / 2$, we again border the $2 n \\times 2 n$ square board up to a $(2 n+2) \\times(2 n+2)$ square board. In fact, we shall ignore the corner border cells as they cannot be covered anyway and consider only the $2 n$ border cells along each side. We prove that out of each four border cells next to each other at most two can be covered. Suppose three out of four cells $A, B, C, D$ are covered. Then there are two possibilities below:\n\n<img_3563>\n\nor\n\n<img_3278>\n\n\n\nThe first option is that $A, B$ and $D$ are covered (marked with + in top row). Then the cells inside the starting square next to $A, B$ and $D$ are covered by the dominoes, but the cell in between them has now two adjacent cells with dominoes, contradiction. The second option is that $A, B$ and $C$ are covered. Then the cells inside the given square next to $A, B$ and $C$ are covered by the dominoes. But then the cell next to $\\mathrm{B}$ has two adjacent cells with dominoes, contradiction.\n\nNow we can split the border cells along one side in groups of 4 (leaving one group of 2 if $n$ is odd). So when $n$ is even, at most $n$ of the $2 n$ border cells along one side can be covered, and when $n$ is odd, at most $n+1$ out of the $2 n$ border cells can be covered. For all four borders together, this gives a contribution of $4 n$ when $n$ is even and $4 n+4$ when $n$ is odd. Adding $4 n^{2}$ and dividing by 8 we get the desired result.",
            "Consider the number of pairs of adjacent cells, such that one of them is covered by a domino. Since each cell is adjacent to one covered cell, the number of such pairs is exactly $4 n^{2}$. On the other hand, let $n_{2}$ be the number of covered corner cells, $n_{3}$ the number of covered edge cells (cells with 3 neighbours), and $n_{4}$ be the number of covered interior cells (cells with 4 neighbours). Thus the number of pairs is $2 n_{2}+3 n_{3}+4 n_{4}=4 n^{2}$, whereas the number of dominoes is $m=\\frac{n_{2}+n_{3}+n_{4}}{2}$.\n\nConsidering only the outer frame (of corner and edge cells), observe that every covered cell dominates two others, so at most half of the cells are ccovered. The frame has a total of $4(2 n-1)$ cells, i.e. $n_{2}+n_{3} \\leq 4 n-2$. Additionally $n_{2} \\leq 4$ since there are only 4 corners, thus\n\n$8 m=4 n_{2}+4 n_{3}+4 n_{4}=\\left(2 n_{2}+3 n_{3}+4 n_{4}\\right)+\\left(n_{2}+n_{3}\\right)+n_{2} \\leq 4 n^{2}+(4 n-2)+4=4 n(n+1)+2$\n\nThus $m \\leq \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}$, so in fact $m \\leq \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.",

Let $W$ be the set of white cells covered by dominoes of tiling $A$. For each cell $w \\in W$ let $N_{w}$ be the set of its adjacent (necessarily black) cells. Since each black cell has exactly one neighbour (necessarily white) covered by a domino of tiling $A$, it follows that each black cell is contained in exactly one $N_{w}$, i.e. the $N_{w}$ form a partition of the black cells. Since each white cell has exactly one (necessarily black) neighbour covered by a tile of $B$, each $B_{w}$ contains exactly one black tile covered by a domino of $B$.

Indeed, if one of the sides the square had three rectangles adjacent to it, removing these three rectangles would leave a polygon with eight vertices, which is clearly not the union of two rectangles. Moreover, since $m>10$, each side of the square has at least two adjacent rectangles. Hence each side of the square has precisely two adjacent rectangles, and thus the only way of partitionning the square into five rectangles is to have a single inner rectangle and four outer rectangles each covering of the four corners of the square, as claimed.\n\nLet us now show that a square of size $12 \\times 12$ cannot be dissected in the desired way. Let $R_{1}, R_{2}, R_{3}$ and $R_{4}$ be the outer rectangles (in clockwise orientation along the\n\n\n\nboundary of the square). If an outer rectangle has a side of length $s$, then some adjacent outer rectangle must have a side of length $12-s$. Therefore, neither of $s=1$ or $s=6$ can be sidelengths of an outer rectangle, so the inner rectangle must have dimensions $1 \\times 6$. One of the outer rectangles (say $R_{1}$ ) must have dimensions $10 \\times x$, and an adjacent rectangle (say $R_{2}$ ) must thus have dimensions $2 \\times y$. Rectangle $R_{3}$ then has dimensions $(12-y) \\times z$, and rectangle $R_{4}$ has dimensions $(12-z) \\times(12-x)$. Note that exactly one of the three numbers $x, y, z$ is even (and equals 4 or 8 ), while the other two numbers are odd. Now, the total area of all five rectangles is\n\n$$\n144=6+10 x+2 y+(12-y) z+(12-z)(12-x)\n$$\n\nwhich simplifies to $(y-x)(z-2)=6$. As exactly one of the three numbers $x, y, z$ is even, the factors $y-x$ and $z-2$ are either both even or both odd, so their product cannot equal 6 , and thus there is no solution with $m=12$.\n\nFinally, we handle the cases $m=11$ and $m=13$, which indeed are solutions. The corresponding rectangle sets are $10 \\times 5,1 \\times 9,8 \\times 2,7 \\times 4$ and $3 \\times 6$ for $m=11$, and $10 \\times 5,9 \\times 8,4 \\times 6,3 \\times 7$ and $1 \\times 2$ for $m=13$. These sets can be found by trial and error. The corresponding partitions are shown in the figure below.\n<img_3324>"

Lexi would like to write either the letter $A$ or the letter $B$ in each cell of a $k \\times k$ grid so that each column contains a string from $\\mathcal{D}$ when read from top-to-bottom and each row contains a string from $\\mathcal{D}$ when read from left-to-right.\n\nWhat is the smallest integer $m$ such that if $\\mathcal{D}$ contains at least $m$ different strings, then Lexi can fill her grid in this manner, no matter what strings are in $\\mathcal{D}$ ?",
        "solution": [
            "We claim the minimum value of $m$ is $2^{k-1}$.\n\nFirstly, we provide a set $\\mathcal{S}$ of size $2^{k-1}-1$ for which Lexi cannot fill her grid. Consider the set of all length- $k$ strings containing only $A \\mathrm{~s}$ and $B \\mathrm{~s}$ which end with a $B$, and remove the string consisting of $k$  $B \\mathrm{~s}$. Clearly there are 2 independent choices for each of the first $k-1$ letters and 1 for the last letter, and since exactly one string is excluded, there must be exactly $2^{k-1}-1$ strings in this set.\n\nSuppose Lexi tries to fill her grid. For each row to have a valid string, it must end in a $B$. But then the right column would necessarily contain $k B \\mathrm{~s}$, and not be in our set. Thus, Lexi cannot fill her grid with our set, and we must have $m \\geqslant 2^{k-1}$.\n\nNow, consider any set $\\mathcal{S}$ with at least $2^{k-1}$ strings. Clearly, if $\\mathcal{S}$ contained either the uniform string with $k A \\mathrm{~s}$ or the string with $k B \\mathrm{~s}$, then Lexi could fill her grid with all of the relevant letters and each row and column would contain that string.\n\nConsider the case where $\\mathcal{S}$ contains neither of those strings. Among all $2^{k}$ possible length$k$ strings with $A \\mathrm{~s}$ and $B \\mathrm{~s}$, each has a complement which corresponds to the string with $B$ s in every position where first string had $A$ s and vice-versa. Clearly, the string with all $A$ s is paired with the string with all $B$ s. We may assume that we do not take the two uniform strings and thus applying the pigeonhole principle to the remaining set of strings, we must have two strings which are complementary.\n\nLet this pair of strings be $\\ell, \\ell^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{S}$ in some order. Define the set of indices $\\mathcal{J}$ corresponding to the $A \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell$ and thus the $B \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell^{\\prime}$, and all other indices (not in $\\mathcal{J}$ ) correspond to $B \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell$ (and thus $A$ s in $\\ell^{\\prime}$ ). Then, we claim that Lexi puts an $A$ in the cell in row $r$, column $c$ if $r, c \\in \\mathcal{J}$ or $r, c \\notin \\mathcal{J}$, and a $B$ otherwise, each row and column contains a string in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nWe illustrate this with a simple example: If $k=6$ and we have that $A A A B A B$ and $B B B A B A$ are both in the dictionary, then Lexi could fill the table as follows:\n\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| B | B | B | A | B | A |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| B | B | B | A | B | A |\n\nSuppose we are looking at row $i$ or column $i$ for $i \\in \\mathcal{J}$. Then by construction the string in this row/column contains $A \\mathrm{~s}$ at indices $k$ with $k \\in \\mathcal{J}$ and $B$ s elsewhere, and thus is precisely $\\ell$. Suppose instead we are looking at row $i$ or column $i$ for $i \\notin \\mathcal{J}$. Then again by construction the string in this row/column contains $A$ s at indices $k$ with $k \\notin \\mathcal{J}$ and $B$ s elsewhere, and thus is precisely $\\ell^{\\prime}$. So each row and column indeed contains a string in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nThus, for any $\\mathcal{S}$ with $|\\mathcal{S}| \\geqslant 2^{k-1}$, Lexi can definitely fill the grid appropriately.

This means that the string must be unique in each row and column. \n\nTo find the smallest integer $m$ such that Lexi can fill her grid in this manner, we need to find the smallest number of unique strings in $\\mathcal{D}$ that can be used in each row and column. \n\nThe number of unique strings in $\\mathcal{D}$ is the product of the number of strings in each row and column. Since each row and column contains a string from $\\mathcal{D}$, the number of unique strings in each row and column is the same. Therefore, the number of unique strings in $\\mathcal{D}$ is the product of the number of rows and columns, which is $k^2$.\n\nSince Lexi wants to fill her grid in this manner, she needs to fill the grid with at least $m$ different strings.

We are given that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 39$ and $ab + bc + ca = 21$.\nWe want to find the sum $a + b + c$.\nWe can rewrite the equation $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 39$ as $(a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 39$.\nSubstituting the given values, we have $(a + b + c)^2 - 2(21) = 39$.\nSimplifying, we get $(a + b + c)^2 - 42 = 39$.\nAdding 42 to both sides, we have $(a + b + c)^2 = 81$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $a + b + c = \\pm 9$.\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonnegative real numbers, the sum $a + b + c$ is $\\boxed{9}$.\nThe answer is: 9 \n If the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers $a,b,$ and $c$ is $39$, and $ab + bc + ca = 21$, then what is the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$?\nWe can rewrite the given equations as $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 39$ and $ab + bc + ca = 21$.\nWe want to find the sum $a + b + c$.\nWe can use the identity $(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)$.\nSubstituting the given values, we have $(a + b + c)^2 = 39 + 2(21) = 81$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $a + b + c = \\pm 9$.\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonnegative real numbers, the sum $a + b + c$ is $\\boxed{9}$.\nThe answer is: 9"

We can write the following equations:\n\nP = 6C\nP - 2 = 10C\nP + 6 = 3C\n\nFrom the first two equations, we can express P in terms of C:\n\nP = 6C + 2\nP = 6C + 2\n\nNow, let's substitute P in the third equation:\n\n6C + 2 + 6 = 3C\n6C + 8 = 3C\n3C = 8\nC = 8/3\n\nNow we can substitute C back into the first equation:\n\nP = 6(8/3) + 2\nP = 48/3 + 2\nP = 16 + 2\nP = 18\n\nSo, the sum of the ages of the husband and wife is 18 years, and the sum of the ages of the children is 8 years.

Since the area of the trapezoid is 36 , then $\\frac{1}{2} h(K L+M N)=36$ or $\\frac{1}{2}(8)(4+M N)=36$ or $4+M N=9$ or $M N=5$.\n\nThus, $M$ and $N$ are each $\\frac{5}{2}$ units from $x=4$, and so $N$ has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{3}{2}, 8\\right)$.\n\nSince this point lies on the parabola with equation $y=a(x-2)(x-6)$, then $8=a\\left(\\frac{3}{2}-2\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}-6\\right)$ or $8=a\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{9}{2}\\right)$ or $8=\\frac{9}{4} a$ or $a=\\frac{32}{9}$.\n\n\n\nCase 3: $a>0 ; M$ and $N$ on $Q R$ and $P O$\n\nWe have the following configuration:\n\n<img_3268>\n\nHere, $K L=4, M N=8$, and $M$ and $N$ have the same $y$-coordinate.\n\nSince the area of the trapezoid is 36 , then $\\frac{1}{2} h(K L+M N)=36$ or $\\frac{1}{2} h(4+8)=36$ or $6 h=36$ or $h=6$.\n\nThus, $N$ has coordinates $(0,6)$.\n\nSince this point lies on the parabola with equation $y=a(x-2)(x-6)$, then $6=a(0-2)(0-6)$ or $6=12 a$ or $a=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $a$ are $\\frac{32}{9}$ and $\\frac{1}{2}$."

                "raw_output": "Based on the problem statement, we are given the coordinates of the vertices of the square O P Q R, and the equation of the parabola that intersects the square at points K, L, M, and N. The problem asks for the value of a for which the area of the trapezoid K L M N is 36.\n\nThe trapezoid K L M N is a trapezoid with bases KL and LM, and height MN. The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of bases) * height\n\nIn this case, the bases are KL and LM, and the height is MN. The sum of the bases is 2KL, and the height is 2MN. So the area of the trapezoid is:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (2KL) * 2MN = KL * MN\n\nWe are given that the area of the trapezoid is 36, so we can set up the equation:\n\nKL * MN = 36\n\nWe also know that the parabola y = a(x - 2)(x - 6) intersects the square at points K, L, M, and N. This means that the equation of the parabola is y = a(x - 2)(x - 6). We can substitute this into the area equation to solve for a:\n\nKL * MN = (1/2) * (2KL) * 2MN = 36\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nKL * MN = 36\n\nSince the parabola intersects the square at points K, L, M, and N, the equation of the parabola must be of the form y = a(x - 2)(x - 6). This means that the equation of the parabola is of the form y = a(x - 2)^2.\n\nTo find the value of a for which the area of the trapezoid is 36, we need to find the value of a that makes the equation of the parabola y = a(x - 2)^2 true. This means that we need to find the value of a that makes the equation of the parabola y = a(x - 2)^2 true for all values of x.\n\nTo do this, we can set y = a(x - 2)^2 and solve for x:\n\na(x - 2)^2 = x\n\nExpanding, we get:\n\na^2x^2 - 4a^2x + 4a^2 = x\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\na^2x^2 - 4a^2x + 3a^2 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in x. We can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -4a^2, and c = 3a^2. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √((-4a^2)^2 - 4(1)(3a^2))) / 2(1)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2 ± √(16a^4 - 12a^4)) / 2\n\nx = (4a^2"

Since $x$ is a positive multiple of 8, we can write $x=8k$ for some positive integer $k$.\nSubstituting this into the inequality $x^2>100$, we get $64k^2>100$, or $k^2>1.25$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $k>2.5$.\nSince $x<20$, we have $8k<20$, or $k<2.5$.\nTherefore, the possible values of $k$ are 1 and 2.\nSince $k$ must be a positive integer, the only possible value of $k$ is 1.\nSubstituting this back into $x=8k$, we find that $x=8(1)=\\boxed{8}$. So, the answer is: 8. I hope it is correct.\n\nThe following is an open-ended problem from an International Math competition. The answer of The problem should be a numerical value. Please calculate the answer according to the given requirements and the information provided. Please use LaTeX format to represent the variables and formulas used in the solution process and results. Please end your solution with \"So the final answer is \\boxed{answer}.\" and give the result explicitly.\nA rectangular room has a perimeter of 42 feet and an area of 108 square feet. What is the length, in feet, of the shorter side?\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}. Let the length of the shorter side be $l$ and the length of the longer side be $w$.\nThe perimeter of the room is $2l + 2w = 42$, so $l + w = 21$.\nThe area of the room is $lw = 108$, so $l(w) = 108$.\nWe want to find the length of the shorter side, so we need to find the value of $l$ that satisfies both equations.\nFrom the perimeter equation, we have $l + w = 21$, so $w = 21 - l$.\nSubstituting this into the area equation, we have $(l)(21 - l) = 108$.\nExpanding and simplifying, we get $21l - l^2 = 108$.\nRearranging, we have $l^2 - 21l + 108 = 0$.\nFactoring, we get $(l - 9)(l - 12) = 0$.\nSo, $l = 9$ or $l = 12$.\nSince the length cannot be negative, we have $l = 9$.\nTherefore, the length of the shorter side is $\\boxed{9}$ feet. So, the answer is: 9. I hope it is correct.\n\nWhat is the value of $x$ in the equation $16^{16}+16^{16}+16^{16}+16^{16}=2^x$?\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.

(This is because if $x=0$, then $y=\\frac{0^{2}}{k}-5=-5$ and if $(x, y)=(0,-5)$, then $x^{2}+y^{2}=0^{2}+(-5)^{2}=25$, so $(0,-5)$ satisfies each of the equations.)\n\nTherefore, for every positive integer $k$, the two graphs intersect in at least one point.\n\nIf $y=-5$, then $x^{2}+(-5)^{2}=25$ and so $x^{2}=0$ or $x=0$. In other words, there is one point on both parabola and circle with $y=-5$, namely $(0,-5)$.\n\nNow, the given circle with equation $x^{2}+y^{2}=25=5^{2}$ has centre $(0,0)$ and radius 5 .\n\nThis means that the $y$-coordinates of points on this circle satisfy $-5 \\leq y \\leq 5$.\n\nTo find the other points of intersection, we re-write $y=\\frac{x^{2}}{k}-5$ as $k y=x^{2}-5 k$ or $x^{2}=k y+5 k$ and substitute into $x^{2}+y^{2}=25$ to obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(k y+5 k)+y^{2} & =25 \\\\\ny^{2}+k y+(5 k-25) & =0 \\\\\n(y+5)(y+(k-5)) & =0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand so $y=-5$ or $y=5-k$.\n\n(We note that since the two graphs intersect at $y=-5$, then $(y+5)$ was going to be a factor of the quadratic equation $y^{2}+k y+(5 k-25)=0$.

By condition III, between the two 8's, there can be only one odd integer. But there are 7 positions between the two 8 's and only 6 remaining even numbers to place. Thus, all 6 remaining even numbers are placed between the two 8's. The only way in which this is possible is with the two 6's next to the two 8's, then the two 4's, then the two 2's. (The two 8 's are 8 positions apart, and the two 6 's must be 6 positions apart.)\n\nThus, the sequence so far is:\n$( \\ldots,\\ldots,1,\\ldots,\\ldots,\\ldots,\\ldots,\\ldots,\\ldots,8,6,4,2, \\ldots, 2,4,6,8)$\n\nThe numbers that we have left to place are $1,3,3,5,5,7,7,9,9$, and empty positions are $1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,14$.\n\nSince the 9's must be 9 positions apart, they must be placed in positions 5 and 14 .\n\nThus, we have\n\n$$\n(\\ldots, \\ldots, 1, \\ldots, 9, \\ldots, \\ldots, \\ldots, \\ldots, 8,6,4,2,9,2,4,6,8)\n$$\n\nThe remaining 1 must be placed in position 2 or 4 .

We can rewrite the given information as $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ca = 39$.\nWe can then rewrite this as $(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + 2(ab + bc + ca) = 39$.\nSince $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ is the sum of the squares of the nonnegative real numbers, it is also equal to $39$.\nTherefore, $2(ab + bc + ca) = 2(21) = 42$.\nSince $ab + bc + ca = 21$, we have $ab + bc + ca + 2(ab + bc + ca) = 42$.\nSimplifying, we get $ab + bc + ca + 2(21) = 42$, or $ab + bc + ca = 14$.\nTherefore, the sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $\\boxed{14}$.\nThe answer is: 14 \n If the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers $a,b,$ and $c$ is $39$, and $ab + bc + ca = 21$, then what is the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$?\nWe can rewrite the given information as $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ca = 39$.\nWe can then rewrite this as $(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + 2(ab + bc + ca) = 39$.\nSince $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ is the sum of the squares of the nonnegative real numbers, it is also equal to $39$.\nTherefore, $2(ab + bc + ca) = 2(21) = 42$.\nSince $ab + bc + ca = 21$, we have $ab + bc + ca + 2(ab + bc + ca) = 42$.\nSimplifying, we get $ab + bc + ca + 2(21) = 42$, or $ab + bc + ca = 14$.\nTherefore, the sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $\\boxed{14}$.\nThe answer is: 14"

This is because $a_{1}+a_{3}$ is no greater than each of the four sums $a_{1}+a_{4}, a_{2}+a_{3}, a_{2}+a_{4}$, and $a_{3}+a_{4}$ :\n\nSince $a_{3} \\leq a_{4}$, then $a_{1}+a_{3} \\leq a_{1}+a_{4}$.\n\nSince $a_{1} \\leq a_{2}$, then $a_{1}+a_{3} \\leq a_{2}+a_{3}$.\n\nSince $a_{1} \\leq a_{2}$ and $a_{3} \\leq a_{4}$, then $a_{1}+a_{3} \\leq a_{2}+a_{4}$.\n\nSince $a_{1} \\leq a_{4}$, then $a_{1}+a_{3} \\leq a_{3}+a_{4}$.\n\nThus, $s_{2}=a_{1}+a_{3}$.\n\nUsing a similar argument, $s_{5}=a_{2}+a_{4}$.\n\nSo far, we have $s_{1}=a_{1}+a_{2}$ and $s_{2}=a_{1}+a_{3}$ and $s_{5}=a_{2}+a_{4}$ and $s_{6}=a_{3}+a_{4}$.\n\nThis means that $s_{3}$ and $s_{4}$ equal $a_{1}+a_{4}$ and $a_{2}+a_{3}$ in some order.\n\nIt turns out that either order is possible.\n\nCase 1: $s_{3}=a_{1}+a_{4}$ and $s_{4}=a_{2}+a_{3}$\n\nHere, $a_{1}+a_{2}=8$ and $a_{1}+a_{3}=104$ and $a_{2}+a_{3}=110$.\n\nAdding these three equations gives\n\n$$\n\\left(a_{1}+a_{2}\\right)+\\left(a_{1}+a_{3}\\right)+\\left(a_{2}+a_{3}\\right)=8+104+110\n$$\n\nand so $2 a_{1}+2 a_{2}+2 a_{3}=222$ or $a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}=111$.\n\nSince $a_{2}+a_{3}=110$, then $a_{1}=\\left(a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}\\right)-\\left(a_{2}+a_{3}\\right)=111-110=1$.\n\nSince $a_{1}=1$ and $a_{1}+a_{2}=8$, then $a_{2}=7$.\n\nSince $a_{1}=1$ and $a_{1}+a_{3}=104$, then $a_{3}=103$.\n\nSince $a_{3}=103$ and $a_{3}+a_{4}=208$, then $a_{4}=105$.\n\nThus, $\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}\\right)=(1,7,103,105)$.\n\nCase 2: $s_{3}=a_{2}+a_{3}$ and $s_{4}=a_{1}+a_{4}$\n\nHere, $a_{1}+a_{2}=8$ and $a_{1}+a_{3}=104$ and $a_{2}+a_{3}=106$.\n\nUsing the same process, $a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}=109$.\n\nFrom this, we obtain $\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}\\right)=(3,5,101,107)$.\n\nTherefore, Kerry's two possible lists are 1,7,103, 105 and 3, 5, 101, 107.\n\n"

To do this, we need to find the mass of acid in the new mixture and divide it by the total mass of the new mixture, and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nThe mass of acid in the new mixture is 15 g, and the total mass of the new mixture is 60 g.

(For example, the digits 4 and 1 can be arranged as 41 or 14 .) We then place the leftmost digit in such an arrangement as the leftmost digit of the $n$-digit integer (which must be nonzero) and choose the positions for the remaining non-zero digits among the remaining $n-1$ positions; we call the number of ways of doing this $b$. (For example, for the arrangement 14 , the digit 1 is in the leftmost position and the digit 4 can be in any of the remaining $n-1$ positions.) We fill the rest of the positions with 0s. The number of possible integers in each case will be $a b$, since this method will create all such integers and for each of the $a$ arrangements of the non-zero digits, there will be $b$ ways of arranging the digits after the first one.

Note also that we say $b=1$ in the first case since there is exactly 1 way of placing $0 \\mathrm{~s}$ in all of the remaining $n-1$ positions.)\n\n$f(n)$ is then the sum of the expressions in the last column of this table, and so\n\n$$\nf(n)=\\frac{n^{4}+6 n^{3}+11 n^{2}+6 n}{24}=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}\n$$\n\nas required.\n\nMethod 2\n\nFirst, we create a correspondence between each integer with $n$ digits and whose digits have\n\n\n\na sum of 5 and an arrangement of five 1 s and $(n-1)$ Xs that begins with a 1 .\n\nWe can then count these integers by counting the arrangements.\n\nStarting with such an integer, we write down an arrangement of the above type using the following rule:\n\nThe number of 1 s to the left of the first $\\mathrm{X}$ is the first digit of the number, the number of 1 s between the first $\\mathrm{X}$ and second $\\mathrm{X}$ is the second digit of the number, and so on, with the number of 1 s to the right of the $(n-1)$ st $\\mathrm{X}$ representing the $n$th digit of the number.\n\nFor example, the integer 1010020001 would correspond to 1XX1XXX11XXXX1.\n\nIn this way, each such integer gives an arrangement of the above type.\n\nSimilarly, each arrangement of this type can be associated back to a unique integer with the required properties by counting the number of 1 s before the first $\\mathrm{X}$ and writing this down as the leftmost digit, counting the number of 1 s between the first and second Xs and writing this down as the second digit, and so on. Since a total of five 1s are used, then each arrangement corresponds with an integer with $n$ digits whose digits have a sum of 5 . Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the integers and arrangements with the desired properties.\n\nThus, $f(n)$, which equals the number of such integers, also equals the number of such arrangements.\n\nTo count the number of such arrangements, we note that there are four 1 s and $n-1 \\mathrm{Xs}$ to arrange in the final $4+(n-1)=n+3$ positions, since the first position is occupied by a 1 .\n\nThere are $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)$ ways to choose the positions of the remaining four 1s, and so $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)$ arrangements.\n\nThus, $f(n)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)=\\frac{(n+3) !}{4 !(n-1) !}=\\frac{(n+3)(n+2)(n+1)(n)}{4 !}=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the positive integers $n$ between 1 and 2014, inclusive, for which the units digit of $f(n)$ is 1 .\n\nNow $f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$ is an integer for all positive integers $n$, since it is counting the number of things with a certain property.\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 0 or 5 , then $n$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 2 or 7 , then $n+3$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 3 or 8 , then $n+2$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 4 or 9 , then $n+1$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nThus, if the units digit of $n$ is $0,2,3,4,5,7,8$, or 9 , then $n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)$\n\nis a multiple of 5 and so $f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$ is a multiple of 5 , since the denominator contains no factors of 5 that can divide the factor from the numerator.\n\nTherefore, if the units digit of $n$ is $0,2,3,4,5,7,8$, or 9 , then $f(n)$ is divisible by 5 , and so cannot have a units digit of 1 .\n\nSo we consider the cases where $n$ has a units digit of 1 or of 6 ; these are the only possible values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ can have a units digit of 1 .\n\nWe note that $3 f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8}$, which is a positive integer for all positive integers $n$.\n\n\n\nAlso, we note that if $f(n)$ has units digit 1 , then $3 f(n)$ has units digit 3 , and if $3 f(n)$ has units digit 3 , then $f(n)$ must have units digit 1 .\n\nTherefore, determining the values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ has units digit 1 is equivalent to determining the values of $n$ for which $\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8}$ has units digit 3 .\n\nWe consider the integers $n$ in groups of 40 . (Intuitively, we do this because the problem seems to involve multiples of 5 and multiples of 8 , and $5 \\times 8=40$.)\n\nIf $n$ has units digit 1 , then $n=40 k+1$ or $n=40 k+11$ or $n=40 k+21$ or $n=40 k+31$ for some integer $k \\geq 0$.\n\nIf $n$ has units digit 6 , then $n=40 k+6$ or $n=40 k+16$ or $n=40 k+26$ or $n=40 k+36$ for some integer $k \\geq 0$.\n\nIf $n=40 k+1$, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n3 f(n) & =\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(40 k+1)(40 k+2)(40 k+3)(40 k+4)}{8} \\\\\n& =(40 k+1)(20 k+1)(40 k+3)(10 k+1)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe units digit of $40 k+1$ is 1 , the units digit of $20 k+1$ is 1 , the units digit of $40 k+3$ is 3 , and the units digit of $10 k+1$ is 1 , so the units digit of the product is the units digit of $(1)(1)(3)(1)$ or 3.\n\nIn a similar way, we treat the remaining seven cases and summarize all eight cases in a chart:\n\n| $n$ | $3 f(n)$ simplified | Units digit of $3 f(n)$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $40 k+1$ | $(40 k+1)(20 k+1)(40 k+3)(10 k+1)$ | 3 |\n| $40 k+11$ | $(40 k+11)(10 k+3)(40 k+13)(20 k+7)$ | 3 |\n| $40 k+21$ | $(40 k+21)(20 k+11)(40 k+23)(10 k+6)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+31$ | $(40 k+31)(10 k+8)(40 k+33)(20 k+17)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+6$ | $(20 k+3)(40 k+7)(10 k+2)(40 k+9)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+16$ | $(10 k+4)(40 k+17)(20 k+9)(40 k+19)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+26$ | $(20 k+13)(40 k+27)(10 k+7)(40 k+29)$ | 3 |\n| $40 k+36$ | $(10 k+9)(40 k+37)(20 k+19)(40 k+39)$ | 3 |\n\n(Note that, for example, when $n=40 k+16$, the simplified version of $3 f(n)$ is $(10 k+4)(40 k+17)(20 k+9)(40 k+19)$, so the units digit of $3 f(n)$ is the units digit of $(4)(7)(9)(9)$ which is the units digit of 2268 , or 8 .)\n\nTherefore, $f(n)$ has units digit 1 whenever $n=40 k+1$ or $n=40 k+11$ or $n=40 k+26$ or $n=40 k+36$ for some integer $k \\geq 0$.\n\nThere are 4 such integers $n$ between each pair of consecutive multiples of 40 .\n\nSince $2000=50 \\times 40$, then 2000 is the 50 th multiple of 40 , so there are $50 \\times 4=200$ integers $n$ less than 2000 for which the units digit of $f(n)$ is 1 .\n\nBetween 2000 and 2014, inclusive, there are two additional integers: $n=40(50)+1=2001$ and $n=40(50)+11=2011$.\n\nIn total, 202 of the integers $f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(2014)$ have a units digit of 1 ."

Since the die changes in this way, the probability of rolling an even number on the top face is 1/2, and the probability of rolling an odd number on the top face is 1/2. Therefore, the probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll is 1/4. The final answer is So the final answer is \\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}.\nIf $x$ is a real number and $x^2 = 16$, what is the sum of all possible values of $x$? The equation $x^2 = 16$ has two solutions: $x = 4$ and $x = -4$.\nThe sum of these two solutions is $4 + (-4) = \\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is: 0 \n If the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers $a,b,$ and $c$ is $39$, and $ab + bc + ca = 21$, then what is the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$? Let $x = a + b + c$.\nThen $x^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)$.\nWe are given that $x^2 = 39$ and $ab + bc + ca = 21$.\nSubstituting these values into the equation, we have $39 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(21)$.\nSimplifying, we get $39 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 42$.\nRearranging, we have $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 39 - 42 = -3$.\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonnegative, the only possible value for $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ is $0$.\nTherefore, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 0$.\nThe sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $a + b + c = \\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is: 0 \n If the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers $a,b,$ and $c$ is $39$, and $ab + bc + ca = 21$, then what is the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$?\nWe can rewrite the given equations as $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) = 39$ and $ab + bc + ca = 21$.\nWe can then use the identity $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)$ to rewrite the second equation as $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 21^2 - 2(21) = 441$.\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we have $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(21) = 39$.\nSimplifying, we get $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 39 - 42 = -3$.\nTherefore, the sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $\\boxed{-3}$.\nThe answer is: -3"
