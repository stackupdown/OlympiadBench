Translating a shape in the plane does not affect the slopes of any line segments.\n\nLet the coordinates of $Y$ be $(2 a, 2 b)$ for some non-zero numbers $a$ and $b$.\n\nSince the slope of $W Y$ is 2 , then $\\frac{2 b-0}{2 a-0}=2$ and so $2 b=4 a$ or $b=2 a$.\n\nThus, the coordinates of $Y$ can be written as $(2 a, 4 a)$.\n\nLet $C$ be the centre of square $W X Y Z$.\n\nThen $C$ is the midpoint of $W Y$, so $C$ has coordinates $(a, 2 a)$.\n\nWe find the slopes of $W X$ and $X Y$ by finding the coordinates of $X$.\n\nConsider the segment $X C$.\n\nSince the diagonals of a square are perpendicular, then $X C$ is perpendicular to $W C$.\n\nSince the slope of $W C$ is 2 , then the slopes of $X C$ and $Z C$ are $-\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSince the diagonals of a square are equal in length and $C$ is the midpoint of both diagonals, then $X C=W C$.\n\nSince $W C$ and $X C$ are perpendicular and equal in length, then the \"rise/run triangle\" above $X C$ will be a $90^{\\circ}$ rotation of the \"rise/run triangle\" below $W C$.\n\n<img_3997>\n\nThis is because these triangles are congruent (each is right-angled, their hypotenuses are of equal length, and their remaining angles are equal) and their hypotenuses are perpendicular.\n\nIn this diagram, we have assumed that $X$ is to the left of $W$ and $Z$ is to the right of $W$. Since the slopes of parallel sides are equal, it does not matter which vertex is labelled $X$ and which is labelled $Z$. We would obtain the same two slopes, but in a different order. To get from $W(0,0)$ to $C(a, 2 a)$, we go up $2 a$ and right $a$.\n\nThus, to get from $C(a, 2 a)$ to $X$, we go left $2 a$ and up $a$.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of $X$ are $(a-2 a, 2 a+a)$ or $(-a, 3 a)$.\n\nThus, the slope of $W X$ is $\\frac{3 a-0}{-a-0}=-3$.\n\nSince $X Y$ is perpendicular to $W X$, then its slope is the negative reciprocal of -3 , which is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe sum of the slopes of $W X$ and $X Y$ is $-3+\\frac{1}{3}=-\\frac{8}{3}$."

The entry $A_{k}$ is directly above the entry $B_{k}$ in the array.\n4. The entry $A_{k}$ is the average of the entry to its left, the entry to its right, and the entry below it.\n5. The entry $B_{k}$ is the average of the entry to its left, the entry to its right, and the entry above it.\n\nNow, we need to find the value of $A_{4}$.\n\nSince the array is infinite, we can assume that the values of $A_{k}$ and $B_{k}$ are all integers. Let's denote the value of $A_{4}$ as $a$.\n\nWe can use the given information to find the value of $A_{4}$:\n\n1. The average of the entry to its left is $A_{-2} + A_{-1} + A_{0} + A_{1} + A_{2} = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2$.\n2. The average of the entry to its right is $B_{-2} + B_{-1} + B_{0} + B_{1} + B_{2} = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2$.\n3. The average of the entry below it is $A_{-2} + A_{-1} + A_{0} + A_{1} + A_{2} + A_{3} = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2$.\n4. The average of the entry above it is $B_{-2} + B_{-1} + B_{0} + B_{1} + B_{2} + B_{3} = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2$.\n\nSince the average of the entry below it is the same as the average of the entry above it, we can conclude that $A_{4} = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $A_{4}$ is 2. So, the answer is: 2.\nIf $x$ is a real number and $x^2 = 16$, what is the sum of all possible values of $x$? The equation $x^2 = 16$ has two solutions: $x = 4$ and $x = -4$.\nThe sum of these solutions is $4 + (-4) = \\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is: 0 \n If the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers $a,b,$ and $c$ is $39$, and $ab + bc + ca = 21$, then what is the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$? We are given that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 39$ and $ab + bc + ca = 21$.\nWe want to find the sum $a + b + c$.\nWe can rewrite the equation $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 39$ as $(a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 39$.\nSubstituting the given values, we have $(a + b + c)^2 - 2(21) = 39$.\nSimplifying, we get $(a + b + c)^2 - 42 = 39$.\nAdding 42 to both sides, we have $(a + b + c)^2 = 81$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $a + b + c = \\pm 9$.\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonnegative, the sum $a + b + c$ is $\\boxed{9}$.\nThe answer is: 9 \n If the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers $a,b,$ and $c$ is $39$, and $ab + bc + ca = 21$, then what is the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$?\nWe can rewrite the given information as $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) = 39$.\nSubstituting $ab + bc + ca = 21$, we have $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(21) = 39$.\nSimplifying, we get $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 42 = 39$.\nTherefore, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 39 - 42 = -3$.\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonnegative, the sum $a + b + c$ is $\\boxed{-3}$.\nThe answer is: -3"

The probability of success in each trial is 1/2, and the probability of failure is 1/2. \n\nIn this problem, Pat and Chris are performing two different operations on the same set of numbers, A, B, and C. Pat is using the proper order of operations, which means he is computing A+(B*C). Chris is using the wrong order of operations, which means he is computing (A+B)*C. \n\nThe binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution, so it is not continuous. However, we can use the binomial distribution to approximate the probability of the correct answer. \n\nTo do this, we can use the binomial probability formula: P(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where n is the number of trials, k is the number of successes, p is the probability of success, and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time. \n\nIn this problem, we are interested in the probability of Pat and Chris getting the same answer, which means we are interested in the probability of k=0, which is the probability of Pat and Chris getting the same answer. \n\nTo find this probability, we can use the binomial probability formula with n=4 and k=0. \n\nP(k=0) = C(4, 0) * (1/2)^0 * (1/2)^4 = 1 * 1 * 1/16 = 1/16 \n\nSo the probability that Pat and Chris get the same answer is 1/16. \n\nNote that this is a very rough approximation, and the actual probability may be different. However, it is a good approximation for the problem at hand.\nWhat is the value of $x$ in the equation $16^{16}+16^{16}+16^{16}+16^{16}=2^x$? We can simplify the left side of the equation as $4(16^{16})=4(2^{4\\cdot 4})=4(2^4)=4(16)=64$.\nSo, the equation becomes $64+64+64+64=2^x$.\nSimplifying further, we have $2(64+64+64+64)=2^x$.\nSimplifying further, we have $2(265)=2^x$.\nTherefore, $265=2^x$.\nSince $265=5\\cdot 5\\cdot 13$, we have $x=\\boxed{6}$.\nThe answer is: 6 \n If the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers $a,b,$ and $c$ is $39$, and $ab + bc + ca = 21$, then what is the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$? We are given that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 39$ and $ab + bc + ca = 21$.\nWe want to find the sum $a + b + c$.\nWe can rewrite the equation $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 39$ as $(a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 39$.\nSubstituting the given values, we have $(a + b + c)^2 - 2(21) = 39$.\nSimplifying, we get $(a + b + c)^2 - 42 = 39$.\nAdding 42 to both sides, we have $(a + b + c)^2 = 81$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $a + b + c = \\pm 9$.\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonnegative, the sum $a + b + c$ is $\\boxed{9}$.\nThe answer is: 9 \n If the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers $a,b,$ and $c$ is $39$, and $ab + bc + ca = 21$, then what is the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$?

For the sake of convenience, write $n=2^{a-1} 19^{b-1} 53^{c-1} 107^{d-1}$, where $a, b, c, d \\geq 1$. Then $D(214 n)=(a+1) b c(d+1)$ and $D(2014 n)=(a+1)(b+1)(c+1) d$. Divide both sides by $a+1$ and expand to get $b c d+b c=b c d+b d+c d+d$, or $b c-b d-c d-d=0$.\n\nBecause the goal is to minimize $n$, try $d=1$ : $b c-b-c-1=0 \\Rightarrow(b-1)(c-1)=2$, which has solutions $(b, c)=(2,3)$ and $(3,2)$. The latter gives the smaller value for $n$, namely $19^{2} \\cdot 53=$ 19133. The only quadruples $(a, b, c, d)$ that satisfy $2^{a-1} 19^{b-1} 53^{c-1} 107^{d-1}<19133$ and $d>1$ are $(1,1,2,2),(1,2,1,2)$, and $(1,1,1,3)$. None of these quadruples satisfies $b c-b d-c d-d=0$, so the minimum value is $n=\\mathbf{1 9 1 3 3}$."

Compute the number of people at the party who shook hands with Ed.\n\nThe problem is asking for the number of people at the party who shook hands with Ed. The solution is as follows:\n\n1. We know that the total number of handshakes is 20T, where T is the number of people at the party.\n2. We also know that Ed leaves early, so we need to subtract the number of handshakes that Ed participated in from the total number of handshakes.\n3.

Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nCompute the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length 6 in $\\mathcal{F}_{8}$.",

Then there are 8 choices for $d_{1}$ and 7 choices for $d_{2}$. There are only 6 choices for $d_{3}$, because $d_{3} \\neq d_{1}$ (otherwise two residents would cook the same pair of dishes). For $k>3$, the requirement that no two intermediate residents cook the same dishes implies that $d_{k+1}$ cannot equal any of $d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{k-1}$, and of course $d_{k}$ and $d_{k+1}$ must be distinct dishes.

        "question": "In each town in ARMLandia, the residents have formed groups, which meet each week to share math problems and enjoy each others' company over a potluck-style dinner. Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.",
        "solution": [
            "First, we compute the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length 6 in $\\mathcal{F}_{8}$.\n\nBecause the town is full, each pair of dishes is cooked by exactly one resident, so it is simplest to identify residents by the pairs of dishes they cook. Suppose the first resident cooks $\\left(d_{1}, d_{2}\\right)$, the second resident $\\left(d_{2}, d_{3}\\right)$, the third resident $\\left(d_{3}, d_{4}\\right)$, and so on, until the sixth resident, who cooks $\\left(d_{6}, d_{1}\\right)$. Then there are 8 choices for $d_{1}$ and 7 choices for $d_{2}$. There are only 6 choices for $d_{3}$, because $d_{3} \\neq d_{1}$ (otherwise two residents would cook the same pair of dishes). For $k>3$, the requirement that no two intermediate residents cook the same dishes implies that $d_{k+1}$ cannot equal any of $d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{k-1}$, and of course $d_{k}$ and $d_{k+1}$ must be distinct dishes. Hence there are $8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3=20,160$ six-person resident cycles, not accounting for different starting points in the cycle and the two different directions to go around the cycle. Taking these into account, there are $20,160 /(6 \\cdot 2)=1,680$ distinguishable resident cycles.\n\nUsing the logic above, there are $d(d-1) \\cdots(d-k+1)$ choices for $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{k}$. To account for indistinguishable cycles, divide by $k$ possible starting points and 2 possible directions, yielding $\\frac{d(d-1) \\cdots(d-k+1)}{2 k}$ or $\\frac{d !}{2 k(d-k) !}$ distinguishable resident cycles."

Let $F$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{B C}$, so that $B F=F C=2$. Let $G$ and $H$ lie on $\\overline{A C}$, with $A G=H C=2$. Now draw the arcs of radius 2 between $E$ and $G, D$ and $F$, and $F$ and $H$. Let the intersection of arc $D F$ and $\\operatorname{arc} E G$ be $J$. Finally, let $M$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{A B}$. The completed diagram is shown below.\n\n<img_3875>\n\nThe region $R$ consisting of all points within $\\triangle A B C$ that lie within 2 units of any vertex is the union of the three sectors $E A G, D B F$, and $F C H$. The angles of these sectors, being the angles $\\angle A, \\angle B$, and $\\angle C$, sum to $180^{\\circ}$, so the sum of their areas is $2 \\pi$. Computing the area of $R$ requires subtracting the areas of all intersections of the three sectors that make up $R$.\n\nThe only sectors that intersect are $E A G$ and $D B F$. Half this area of intersection, the part above $\\overline{M J}$, equals the difference between the areas of sector $D B J$ and of $\\triangle M B J$. Triangle $M B J$ is a $1: \\sqrt{3}: 2$ right triangle because $B M=\\sqrt{3}$ and $B J=2$, so the area of $\\triangle M B J$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Sector $D B J$ has area $\\frac{1}{12}(4 \\pi)=\\frac{\\pi}{3}$, because $\\mathrm{m} \\angle D B J=30^{\\circ}$. Therefore the area of intersection of the sectors is $2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{2 \\pi}{3}-\\sqrt{3}$. Hence the total area of $R$ is $2 \\pi-\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi}{3}-\\sqrt{3}\\right)=\\frac{4 \\pi}{3}+\\sqrt{3}$. The total area of $\\triangle A B C$ is $4 \\sqrt{3}$, therefore the desired probability is $\\frac{\\frac{4 \\pi}{3}+\\sqrt{3}}{4 \\sqrt{3}}=\\frac{\\pi}{3 \\sqrt{3}}+\\frac{1}{4}$.

Subtracting the first equation from this, we get $a^2+b^2+c^2-ab-bc-ca=30-21=9$. Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonnegative, we can divide by 2 to get $a^2+b^2+c^2-ab-bc-ca=9/2$.

Subtracting this from the first equation, we get $a^2+b^2+c^2-2(ab+bc+ca)=39-21$, or $a^2+b^2+c^2-2(ab+bc+ca)=18$. Adding this to the second equation, we get $a^2+b^2+c^2+2(ab+bc+ca)-2(ab+bc+ca)=18+21$, or $a^2+b^2+c^2=39+21=60$. Therefore, the sum of a, b, and c is $\\boxed{60}$.

This is a quadratic equation in x, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a.\n11. In this case, a = 1, b = 2, and c = -14.\n12. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n13. x = (-2 ± √(2^2 - 4(1)(-14))) / 2(1)\n14. x = (-2 ± √(4 + 56)) / 2\n15. x = (-2 ± √60) / 2\n16. The two possible values for x are -1.5 and 1.5.\n17. Since we are looking for the farthest lattice point, we take the positive value, so the farthest lattice point is (-1.5, 1.5, 0).\n18. Therefore, the ordered triple $(x, y, z)$ representing the farthest lattice point from the origin that satisfies the given equation is (-1.5, 1.5, 0).\n19.

Suppose that $A_{2}=0$ and $A_{3}=A_{1}$, so that the number begins $\\underline{A_{1}} \\underline{0} \\underline{A_{1}} \\underline{A_{4}}$. If the number is to be fibbish, $A_{4} \\geq A_{1}>0$. Then if $A_{1} \\geq 2$ and $A_{4} \\geq 2$, because the number is fibbish, $A_{5} \\geq 4$, and $A_{6} \\geq 6$. In this case there can be no more digits, because $A_{5}+A_{6} \\geq 10$. So the largest possible fibbish number beginning with 20 is 202246. If $A_{1}=2$ and $A_{2}=1$, then $A_{3}$ must be at least 3 , and the largest possible number is 21459; changing $A_{3}$ to 3 does not increase the length. Now consider $A_{1}=1$. If $A_{2}=1$, then $A_{3} \\geq 2, A_{4} \\geq 3, A_{5} \\geq 5$, and $A_{6} \\geq 8$. There can be no seventh digit because that digit would have to be at least 13 . Increasing $A_{3}$ to 3 yields only two additional digits, because $A_{4} \\geq 4, A_{5} \\geq 7$. So $A_{3}=2$ yields a longer (and thus larger) number. Increasing $A_{4}$ to 4 yields only one additional digit, $A_{5} \\geq 6$, because $A_{4}+A_{5} \\geq 10$. But if $A_{4}=3$, increasing $A_{5}$ to 6 still allows $A_{6}=9$, yielding the largest possible number of digits (8) and the largest fibbish number with that many digits."

            "Note that any portion of side length $m \\geq 4$ will overlap the center square, so consider only portions of side length 3 or less. If there were no hole in the candy bar, the number of portions could be counted by conditioning on the possible location of the upper-left corner of the portion. If the portion is of size $1 \\times 1$, then the corner can occupy any of the $7^{2}$ squares of the bar. If the portion is of size $2 \\times 2$, then the corner can occupy any of the top 6 rows and any of the left 6 columns, for $6^{2}=36$ possible $2 \\times 2$ portions. In general, the upper-left corner of an $m \\times m$ portion can occupy any of the top $8-m$ rows and any of the left $8-m$ columns. So the total number of portions from an intact bar would be $7^{2}+6^{2}+5^{2}$. Now when $m \\leq 3$, the number of $m \\times m$ portions that include the missing square is simply $m^{2}$, because the missing square could be any square of the portion. So the net number of portions is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n7^{2}+6^{2}+5^{2}-3^{2}-2^{2}-1^{2} & =(49+36+25)-(9+4+1) \\\\\n& =110-14 \\\\\n& =\\mathbf{9 6}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$",
            "First ignore the missing square. As in the previous solution, the number of $m \\times m$ portions that can fit in the bar is $(8-m)^{2}$. So the total number of portions of all sizes is simply\n\n$$\n7^{2}+6^{2}+\\cdots+1^{2}=\\frac{7(7+1)(2 \\cdot 7+1)}{6}=140\n$$\n\nTo exclude portions that overlap the missing center square, it is useful to consider the location of the missing square within the portion. If an $m \\times m$ portion includes the missing center\n\n\n\nsquare, and $m \\leq 4$, then the missing square could be any one of the $m^{2}$ squares in the portion. If $m=5$, then the missing square cannot be in the leftmost or rightmost columns of the portion, because then the entire bar would have to extend at least four squares past the hole, and it only extends three. By similar logic, the square cannot be in the top or bottom rows of the portion. So for $m=5$, there are $3 \\cdot 3=9$ possible positions. For $m=6$, the two left and two right columns are excluded, as are the two top and the two bottom rows, for $2 \\cdot 2=4$ possible positions for the portion. And in a $7 \\times 7$ square, the only possible location of the hole is in the center. So the total number of portions overlapping the missing square is\n\n$$\n1^{2}+2^{2}+3^{2}+4^{2}+3^{2}+2^{2}+1^{2}=44 .\n$$\n\nThe difference is thus $140-44=\\mathbf{9 6}$"

The perimeter of a regular hexagon is given by the formula $P = 6 \\cdot s$, where $s$ is the side length. \n\nIn this case, the perimeter of the hexagon $A B C D E F$ is $P = 6 \\cdot 24 = 144$. \n\nThe perimeter of the hexagon $G H I J K L$ is also $144$. \n\nSince the hexagons overlap, the distance between the centers of the two hexagons is equal to the sum of the lengths of the sides of the overlap. \n\nThe length of the overlap is the sum of the lengths of the sides of the overlap, which is $24 + 24 = 48$. \n\nTherefore, the length of $L F$ is $144 - 48 = 96$. \n\nSo, the final answer is 96.\nIf $x$ is a real number and $x^2 = 16$, what is the sum of all possible values of $x$?

The Law of Cosines states that for a triangle with sides a, b, and c and an angle C opposite side c, the following equation holds:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, the sides of the regular $n$-gon are $a = n\\cos(C)$, $b = n\\cos(C)$, and $c = n\\cos(C)$. The angle C is given as 159 degrees, so we can substitute these values into the Law of Cosines equation:\n\nn^2 = n^2 * cos(159) + n^2 * cos(159) - 2 * n * n * cos(159)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nn^2 = 2n^2 * cos(159)\n\nDividing both sides by 2n^2, we get:\n\nn = 2 * cos(159)\n\nSince cos(159) is between -1 and 1, the smallest possible value of n is 2. Therefore, the smallest possible value of n is 2. So the final answer is 2.\nIf $x$ is a real number and $x^2 = 16$, what is the sum of all possible values of $x$?

The binary representation of n is 2n, where n is a positive integer. The number of 1's in the binary representation of n is C(n), which is the number of pairs of consecutive 1's in the binary representation of n.\n\nThe problem is asking to compute C(1)+C(2)+C(3)+...+C(256). This is a sum of the number of 1's in the binary representation of each number from 1 to 256. \n\nTo compute this sum, we can use the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers: \n\nsum = n * (n + 1) / 2\n\nFor n = 256, the sum is:\n\nsum = 256 * (256 + 1) / 2 = 256 * 257 / 2 = 256 * 128 = 32008\n\nSo the final answer is 32008.\nIf $x$ is a real number and $x^2 = 16$, what is the sum of all possible values of $x$?

        "question": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\\mathcal{N}(n)=\\{m \\mid d(m)=d(n)\\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.\n\nLater, ARMLopolis finally decides on a drastic expansion plan: now house numbers will be rational numbers. To define $d(p / q)$, with $p$ and $q$ integers such that $p q \\neq 0$, write $p / q=3^{k} p^{\\prime} / q^{\\prime}$, where neither $p^{\\prime}$ nor $q^{\\prime}$ is divisible by 3 and $k$ is an integer (not necessarily positive); then $d(p / q)=3^{-k}$.\nCompute $d(3 / 5), d(5 / 8)$, and $d(7 / 18)$.",

Therefore the base angles $L$ and $M$ have measure $72^{\\circ}$ while the other base angles $A$ and $R$ have measure $108^{\\circ}$.

The equation $x^2 = 16$ has two solutions: $x = 4$ and $x = -4$.\nThe sum of these solutions is $4 + (-4) = \\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed{0} # The answer is: \\boxed"

            "If $f$ is simply a permutation of $S$, then $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is periodic. To understand why, consider a smaller set $T=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\\}$. If $f:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,7,8,6,9,10]$, then $f$ has one cycle of period 5 and one cycle of period 3 , so the period of $f$ is 15 . However,\n\n$$\nf(1)+f(2)+f(3)+f(4)+f(5)+f(6)+f(7)+f(8)+f(9)+f(10)=\n$$\n\n\n\n$$\n2+3+4+5+1+7+8+6+9+10=55,\n$$\n\nbecause $f$ just rearranges the order of the summands. So $s_{1}=s_{0}$, and for all $n, s_{n}=s_{n+1}$; in short, the period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is just 1 .\n\nIn order for $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ to have a period greater than $1, f$ must be many-to-one, so that some values occur more than once (and some values do not occur at all) in the sum $f(1)+f(2)+\\cdots+f(10)$ (or, in the original problem, $f(1)+f(2)+\\cdots+f(20)$ ). For example, consider the function $f_{2}$ below:\n\n$$\nf_{2}:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,10,9,10,7,3]\n$$\n\nNote that $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+1+10+9+10+7+3 \\neq 55$, so $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is not immediately periodic. But $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is eventually periodic, as the following argument shows. The function $f_{2}$ has two cycles: $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 1$, and $7 \\rightarrow 9 \\rightarrow 7$. There are also two paths that meet up with the first cycle: $6 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow \\cdots$ and $8 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow \\cdots$. Thus for all $k$ in $T, f_{2}\\left(f_{2}(k)\\right)$ is an element of one of these two extended cycles. Thus $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ eventually becomes periodic.\n\nThe criterion that the function be many-to-one is necessary, but not sufficient, for $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ to have period greater than 1 . To see why, consider the function $g:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow$ $[2,3,4,5,6,1,8,7,8,7]$. This function is many-to-one, and contains two cycles, $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow$ $3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 6 \\rightarrow 1$ and $7 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 7$. But because $g(9)=8$ and $g(10)=7$, the sum $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+6+1+8+7+8+7$, while $s_{2}=3+4+5+6+1+2+7+8+7+8$. In fact, for $n>1, s_{n+1}=s_{n}$, because applying $f$ only permutes the 6 -cycle and switches the two 7 's and two 8's. That is, in the list $\\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(1), \\ldots, \\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(10)$, the values 7 and 8 both show up exactly twice. This cycle is balanced: each of its elements shows up the same number of times for all $n$ in the list $\\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(1), \\ldots, \\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(10)$, for all $n$ after a certain point. The conclusion is that not all many-to-one functions produce unbalanced cycles.\n\nThere are two ways a function $g$ can produce balanced cycles. First, the cycles can be selfcontained, so no element outside of the cycle is ever absorbed into the cycle, as happens with the 6-cycle in the example above. Alternatively, the outside elements that are absorbed into a cycle can all arrive at different points of the cycle, so that each element of the cycle occurs equally often in each iteration of $g$. In the example above, the values $g(9)=7$ and $g(10)=8$ balance the $7 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 7$ cycle. On the other hand, in the function $f_{2}$ above, $f(f(6))=f(f(8))=f(f(1))=3$, making the large cycle unbalanced: in $s_{2}$, the value 3 appears three times in $s_{2}$, but the value 2 only appears once in $s_{2}$.\n\nThe foregoing shows that only unbalanced cycles can affect the periodicity of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$. Because each element of a balanced cycle occurs equally often in each iteration, the period of that component of the sum $s_{n}$ attributed to the cycle is simply 1. (The case where $f$ is a permutation of $S$ is simply a special case of this result.) In the above example, the large cycle is\n\n\n\nunbalanced. Note the following results under $f_{2}$.\n\n| $n$ | $\\overbrace{\\left(f_{2} \\circ \\cdots \\circ f_{2}\\right)}^{n}(T)$ | $s_{n}$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 1 | $[2,3,4,5,1,10,9,10,7,3]$ | 54 |\n| 2 | $[3,4,5,1,2,3,7,3,9,4]$ | 41 |\n| 3 | $[4,5,1,2,3,4,9,4,7,5]$ | 40 |\n| 4 | $[5,1,2,3,4,5,7,5,9,1]$ | 42 |\n| 5 | $[1,2,3,4,5,1,9,1,7,2]$ | 35 |\n| 6 | $[2,3,4,5,1,2,7,2,9,3]$ | 38 |\n| 7 | $[3,4,5,1,2,3,9,3,7,4]$ | 41 |\n| 8 | $[4,5,1,2,3,4,7,4,9,5]$ | 40 |\n| 9 | $[5,1,2,3,4,5,9,5,7,1]$ | 42 |\n\nThe period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ for $f_{2}$ is 5 , the period of the unbalanced cycle.\n\nThe interested reader may inquire whether all unbalanced cycles affect the periodicity of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$; we encourage those readers to explore the matter independently. For the purposes of solving this problem, it is sufficient to note that unbalanced cycles can affect $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ 's periodicity.\n\nFinally, note that an unbalanced $k$-cycle actually requires at least $k+1$ elements: $k$ to form the cycle, plus at least 1 to be absorbed into the cycle and cause the imbalance. For the original set $S$, one way to create such an imbalance would be to have $f(20)=f(1)=$ $2, f(2)=3, f(3)=4, \\ldots, f(19)=1$. This arrangement creates an unbalanced cycle of length 19. But breaking up into smaller unbalanced cycles makes it possible to increase the period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ even more, because then in most cases the period is the least common multiple of the periods of the unbalanced cycles. For example, $f:[1,2,3, \\ldots, 20]=$ $[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,1,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,11,11,11]$ has an unbalanced cycle of length 9 and an unbalanced cycle of length 8 , giving $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ a period of 72 .\n\nSo the goal is to maximize $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left\\{k_{1}, k_{2}, \\ldots, k_{m}\\right\\}$ such that $k_{1}+k_{2}+\\cdots+k_{m}+m \\leq 20$. With $m=2$, the maximal period is 72 , achieved with $k_{1}=9$ and $k_{2}=8$. With $m=3$, $k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3} \\leq 17$, but $\\operatorname{lcm}\\{7,6,4\\}=84<\\operatorname{lcm}\\{7,5,4\\}=140$. This last result can be obtained with unbalanced cycles of length 4,5 , and 7 , with the remaining four points entering the three cycles (or with one point forming a balanced cycle of length 1, i.e., a fixed point). Choosing larger values of $m$ decreases the values of $k$ so far that they no longer form long cycles: when $m=4, k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3}+k_{4} \\leq 16$, and even if $k_{4}=2, k_{3}=3$, and $k_{2}=5$, for a period of 30 , the largest possible value of $k_{1}=6$, which does not alter the period. (Even $k_{1}=7, k_{2}=5$, and $k_{3}=k_{4}=2$ only yields a period of 70 .) Thus the maximum period of $s_{n}$ is $\\mathbf{1 4 0}$. One such function $f$ is given below.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccccccccccccccccc}\nn & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 19 & 20 \\\\\n\\hline f(n) & 2 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 6 & 6 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 12 & 12 & 20\n\\end{array}\n$$"
