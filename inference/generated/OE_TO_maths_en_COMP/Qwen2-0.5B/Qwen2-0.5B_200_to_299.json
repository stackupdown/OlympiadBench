Since $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $b<a+c$ and $a<b+c$ follow automatically, so only $c<a+b$ ever needs to be checked.\n\nInstead of directly considering triangles and sets of triangle, we can consider triples $(a, b, c)$ and sets of triples $(a, b, c)$ with the appropriate conditions.\n\nFor each positive integer $k \\geq 3$, we use the notation $S_{k}$ to denote the set of triples of positive integers $(a, b, c)$ with $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $c<a+b$ and $a+b+c=k$.\n\nIn this case, $c<a+b$ and $a+b+c=k$, so $c+c<a+b+c=k$, so $2 c<k$ or $c<\\frac{1}{2} k$.\n\nAlso, if $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $a+b+c=k$, then $k=a+b+c \\leq c+c+c$, so $3 c \\geq k$ or $c \\geq \\frac{1}{3} k$.\n\n\nWe will use two important facts:\n\n(F1) $T(2 m)=T(2 m-3)$ for every positive integer $m \\geq 3$, and\n\n(F2) $T(k) \\leq T(k+2)$ for every positive integer $k \\geq 3$\n\nFirst, we prove (F1):\n\n\nWe show that $T(2 m)=T(2 m-3)$ by creating a one-to-one correspondence between the triples in $S_{2 m}$ and the triples $S_{2 m-3}$.\n\nNote that $S_{2 m}$ is the set of triples $(a, b, c)$ of positive integers with $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$, with $c<a+b$, and with $a+b+c=2 m$.\n\nAlso, $S_{2 m-3}$ is the set of triples $(A, B, C)$ of positive integers with $0<A \\leq B \\leq C$, with $C<A+B$, and with $A+B+C=2 m-3$.\n\nConsider a triple $(a, b, c)$ in $S_{2 m}$ and a corresponding triple $(a-1, b-1, c-1)$.\n\nWe show that $(a-1, b-1, c-1)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$ :\n\n* Since $(a, b, c)$ is in $S_{2 m}$, then $c<\\frac{1}{2}(2 m)=m$. This means that $b \\leq c \\leq m-1$, so $a=2 m-b-c \\geq 2$. Therefore, $a-1, b-1$ and $c-1$ are positive integers since $a, b$ and $c$ are positive integers with $2 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq c$.\n* Since $2 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $1 \\leq a-1 \\leq b-1 \\leq c-1$, so $0<a-1 \\leq b-1 \\leq c-1$.\n* Since $a+b+c=2 m$, then $c=2 m-(a+b)$ so $a+b$ and $c$ have the same parity.\n\nSince $c<a+b$, then $c \\leq a+b-2$. (In other words, it cannot be the case that $c=a+b-1$.) Therefore, $c-1 \\leq(a-1)+(b-1)-1$; that is, $c-1<(a-1)+(b-1)$.\n\n$*$ Since $a+b+c=2 m$, then $(a-1)+(b-1)+(c-1)=2 m-3$.\n\nTherefore, $(a-1, b-1, c-1)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$, since it satisfies all of the conditions of $S_{2 m-3}$. Note as well that two different triples in $S_{2 m}$ correspond to two different triples in $S_{2 m-3}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{2 m}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{2 m-3}$.\n\nThus, $T(2 m) \\leq T(2 m-3)$.\n\nConsider a triple $(A, B, C)$ in $S_{2 m-3}$ and a corresponding triple $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$. We show that $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$ is in $S_{2 m}$ :\n\n* Since $(A, B, C)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$, then $A, B$ and $C$ are positive integers, so $A+1, B+1$ and $C+1$ are positive integers.\n* Since $0<A \\leq B \\leq C$, then $1<A+1 \\leq B+1 \\leq C+1$, so $0<A+1 \\leq B+1 \\leq C+1$.\n* Since $C<A+B$, then $C+1<(A+1)+(B+1)-1$ so $C+1<(A+1)+(B+1)$.\n* Since $A+B+C=2 m-3$, then $(A+1)+(B+1)+(C+1)=2 m$.\n\nTherefore, $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$ is in $S_{2 m}$.\n\nNote again that two different triples in $S_{2 m-3}$ correspond to two different triples in $S_{2 m}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{2 m-3}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{2 m}$.\n\nTherefore, $T(2 m-3) \\leq T(2 m)$.\n\nSince $T(2 m) \\leq T(2 m-3)$ and $T(2 m-3) \\leq T(2 m)$, then $T(2 m)=T(2 m-3)$.\n\n\nNext, we prove (F2):\n\nConsider a triple $(a, b, c)$ in $S_{k}$ and a corresponding triple $(a, b+1, c+1)$. We show that the triple $(a, b+1, c+1)$ is in $S_{k+2}$ :\n\n* Since $a, b$ and $c$ are positive integers, then $a, b+1$ and $c+1$ are positive integers.\n\n\n\n* Since $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $0<a \\leq b+1 \\leq c+1$.\n* Since $c<a+b$, then $c+1<a+(b+1)$.\n\n$*$ Since $a+b+c=k$, then $a+(b+1)+(c+1)=k+2$.\n\nTherefore, $(a, b+1, c+1)$ is in $S_{k+2}$. Note that, using this correspondence, different triples in $S_{k}$ correspond different triples in $S_{k+2}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{k}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{k+2}$. This proves that $T(k) \\leq T(k+2)$.\n\nSuppose that $n=N$ is the smallest positive integer for which $T(n)>2010$.\n\nThen $N$ must be odd:\n\nIf $N$ was even, then by (F1), $T(N-3)=T(N)>2010$ and so $n=N-3$ would be an integer smaller than $N$ with $T(n)>2010$. This contradicts the fact that $n=N$ is the smallest such integer.\n\nTherefore, we want to find the smallest odd positive integer $N$ for which $T(N)>2010$. Next, we note that if we can find an odd positive integer $n$ such that $T(n)>2010 \\geq$ $T(n-2)$, then we will have found the desired value of $n$ :\n\nThis is because $n$ and $n-2$ are both odd, and by property (F2), any smaller odd positive integer $k$ will give $T(k) \\leq T(n-2) \\leq 2010$ and any larger odd positive integer $m$ will give $T(m) \\geq T(n)>2010$.\n\nWe show that $N=309$ is the desired value of $N$ by showing that $T(309)>2010$ and $T(307) \\leq 2010$.\n\nCalculation of $T(309)$\n\nWe know that $\\frac{309}{3} \\leq c<\\frac{309}{2}$, so $103 \\leq c \\leq 154$.\n\nFor each admissible value of $c$, we need to count the number of pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ with $a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $a+b=309-c$.\n\nFor example, if $c=154$, then we need $a \\leq b \\leq 154$ and $a+b=155$.\n\nThis gives pairs $(1,154),(2,153), \\ldots,(76,79),(77,78)$, of which there are 77 .\n\nAlso, if $c=153$, then we need $a \\leq b \\leq 153$ and $a+b=156$.\n\nThis gives pairs $(3,153), \\ldots,(77,79),(78,78)$, of which there are 76 .\n\nIn general, if $c$ is even, then the minimum possible value of $a$ occurs when $b$ is as large as possible - that is, when $b=c$, so $a \\geq 309-2 c$.\n\nAlso, the largest possible value of $a$ occurs when $a$ and $b$ are as close to equal as possible. Since $c$ is even, then $309-c$ is odd, so $a$ and $b$ cannot be equal, but they can differ by 1 . In this case, $a=154-\\frac{1}{2} c$ and $b=155-\\frac{1}{2} c$.\n\nTherefore, if $c$ is even, there are $\\left(154-\\frac{1}{2} c\\right)-(309-2 c)+1=\\frac{3}{2} c-154$ possible pairs $(a, b)$ and so $\\frac{3}{2} c-154$ possible triples.\n\nIn general, if $c$ is odd, then the minimum possible value of $a$ occurs when $b$ is as large as possible - that is, when $b=c$, so $a \\geq 309-2 c$.\n\nAlso, the largest possible value of $a$ occurs when $a$ and $b$ are as close to equal as possible.\n\nSince $c$ is odd, then $309-c$ is even, so $a$ and $b$ can be equal. In this case, $a=\\frac{1}{2}(309-c)$. Therefore, if $c$ is odd, there are $\\frac{1}{2}(309-c)-(309-2 c)+1=\\frac{3}{2} c-\\frac{307}{2}$ possible pairs $(a, b)$ and so $\\frac{3}{2} c-\\frac{307}{2}$ possible triples.\n\nThe possible even values of $c$ are 104,106,...,152,154 (there are 26 such values) and the possible odd values of $c$ are 103,105,...,151,153 (there are 26 such values).\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nT(309)= & \\left(\\frac{3}{2}(104)-154\\right)+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(106)-154\\right)+\\cdots+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(154)-154\\right)+ \\\\\n& \\quad\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(103)-\\frac{307}{2}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(105)-\\frac{307}{2}\\right)+\\cdots+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(153)-\\frac{307}{2}\\right) \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2}(104+106+\\cdots+154)-26 \\cdot 154+\\frac{3}{2}(103+105+\\cdots+153)-26 \\cdot \\frac{307}{2} \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2}(103+104+105+106+\\cdots+153+154)-26 \\cdot 154-26 \\cdot \\frac{307}{2} \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}(103+154)(52)-26 \\cdot 154-26 \\cdot \\frac{307}{2} \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2}(26)(257)-26 \\cdot 154-26 \\cdot \\frac{307}{2} \\\\\n= & 2028\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, $T(309)>2010$, as required.\n\nCalculation of $T(307)$\n\nWe know that $\\frac{307}{3} \\leq c<\\frac{307}{2}$, so $103 \\leq c \\leq 153$.\n\nFor each admissible value of $c$, we need to count the number of pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ with $a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $a+b=307-c$.\n\nThis can be done in a similar way to the calculation of $T(309)$ above.\n\nIf $n$ is even, there are $\\frac{3}{2} c-153$ possible triples.\n\nIf $n$ is odd, there are $\\frac{3}{2} c-\\frac{305}{2}$ possible triples.\n\nThe possible even values of $c$ are $104,106, \\ldots, 150,152$ (there are 25 such values) and the possible odd values of $c$ are $103,105, \\ldots, 151,153$ (there are 26 such values).\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nT(307)= & \\left(\\frac{3}{2}(104)-153\\right)+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(106)-153\\right)+\\cdots+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(152)-153\\right)+ \\\\\n& \\quad\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(103)-\\frac{305}{2}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(105)-\\frac{305}{2}\\right)+\\cdots+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(153)-\\frac{305}{2}\\right) \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2}(104+106+\\cdots+152)-25 \\cdot 153+\\frac{3}{2}(103+105+\\cdots+153)-26 \\cdot \\frac{305}{2} \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2}(103+104+105+106+\\cdots+152+153)-25 \\cdot 153-26 \\cdot \\frac{305}{2} \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}(103+153)(51)-25 \\cdot 153-26 \\cdot \\frac{305}{2} \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2}(51)(128)-25 \\cdot 153-26 \\cdot \\frac{305}{2} \\\\\n= & 2002\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, $T(307)<2010$, as required.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $T(n)>2010$ is $n=309$.\n\nAs a final note, we discuss briefly how one could guess that the answer was near $N=309$.\n\nConsider the values of $T(n)$ for small odd positive integers $n$.\n\nIn (a), by considering the possible values of $c$ from smallest (roughly $\\frac{1}{3} n$ ) to largest (roughly $\\frac{1}{2} n$ ), we saw that $T(11)=1+3=4$.\n\nIf we continue to calculate $T(n)$ for a few more small odd values of $n$ we will see that:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& T(13)=2+3=5 \\\\\n& T(15)=1+2+4=7 \\\\\n& T(17)=1+3+4=8 \\\\\n& T(19)=2+3+5=10 \\\\\n& T(21)=1+2+4+5=12 \\\\\n& T(23)=1+3+4+6=14\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\n\nThe pattern that seems to emerge is that for $n$ odd, $T(n)$ is roughly equal to the sum of the integers from 1 to $\\frac{1}{4} n$, with one out of every three integers removed. Thus, $T(n)$ is roughly equal to $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the sum of the integers from 1 to $\\frac{1}{4} n$. Therefore, $T(n) \\approx \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{4} n\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{4} n+1\\right) \\approx \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{4} n\\right)^{2} \\approx \\frac{1}{48} n^{2}$.\n\nIt makes sense to look for an odd positive integer $n$ with $T(n) \\approx 2010$.\n\nThus, we are looking for a value of $n$ that roughly satisfies $\\frac{1}{48} n^{2} \\approx 2010$ or $n^{2} \\approx 96480$ or $n \\approx 310$.\n\nSince $n$ is odd, then it makes sense to consider $n=309$, as in the solution above."

We can plug these values into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2 * (27 cm² + 32 cm² + 32 cm² + 144 cm²) = 2 * 100 cm² = 200 cm²\n\nSo the final answer is 200 cm².

The equation $x^2 = 16$ has two solutions: $x = 4$ and $x = -4$.\nThe sum of these solutions is $4 + (-4) = \\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is: 0 \n If the sum of the first and third consecutive even integers is 128, what is the sum of all three consecutive even integers? Let the first even integer be $2n$ and the third even integer be $2n+2$.\nThe sum of the first and third consecutive even integers is $(2n)+(2n+2)=4n+2$.\nWe are given that this sum is 128, so $4n+2=128$.\nSolving for $n$, we find $n=32$.\nTherefore, the sum of all three consecutive even integers is $2(32)+2=64+2=\\boxed{66}$.\nThe answer is: 66 \n If the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers $a,b,$ and $c$ is $39$, and $ab + bc + ca = 21$, then what is the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$?\nWe can rewrite the given information as $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ca = 39$.\nWe can then rewrite this as $(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + 2(ab + bc + ca) = 39$.\nSince $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ is the sum of the squares of the nonnegative real numbers, it is also equal to $39$.\nTherefore, $2(ab + bc + ca) = 39 - 2(21) = 13$.\nSince $ab + bc + ca = 21$, we can rewrite this as $ab + bc + ca = 13$.\nTherefore, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 39 - 13 = 26$.\nThe sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $a + b + c = \\boxed{26}$.\nThe answer is: 26"

        "question": "A positive integer $n$ is called \"savage\" if the integers $\\{1,2,\\dots,n\\}$ can be partitioned into three sets $A, B$ and $C$ such that\n\ni) the sum of the elements in each of $A, B$, and $C$ is the same,\n\nii) $A$ contains only odd numbers,\n\niii) $B$ contains only even numbers, and\n\niv) C contains every multiple of 3 (and possibly other numbers).\nDetermine all even savage integers less than 100.",
        "solution": [
            "First, we prove lemma (b): if $n$ is an even savage integer, then $\\frac{n+4}{12}$ is an integer.\n\nProof of lemma (b):\nWe use the strategy of putting all of the multiples of 3 between 1 and $n$ in the set $C$, all of the remaining even numbers in the set $B$, and all of the remaining numbers in the set $A$. The sums of these sets will not likely all be equal, but we then try to adjust the sums to by moving elements out of $A$ and $B$ into $C$ to try to make these sums equal. (Notice that we can't move elements either into $A$ or $B$, or out of $C$.) We will use the notation $|C|$ to denote the sum of the elements of $C$.\n\nSince we are considering the case of $n$ even and we want to examine multiples of 3 less than or equal to $n$, it makes sense to consider $n$ as having one of the three forms $6 k$, $6 k+2$ or $6 k+4$. (These forms allow us to quickly tell what the greatest multiple of 3 less than $n$ is.)\n\nCase 1: $n=6 k$\n\nIn this case, $C$ contains at least the integers $3,6,9, \\ldots, 6 k$, and so the sum of $C$ is greater than one-third of the sum of the integers from 1 to $n$, since if we divide the integers from 1 to $n=6 k$ into groups of 3 consecutive integers starting with 1,2, 3 , then the set $C$ will always contain the largest of the 3 .\n\n\n\nCase 2: $n=6 k+4$\n\nHere, the sum of the integers from 1 to $n=6 k+4$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(6 k+4)(6 k+5)=18 k^{2}+27 k+10=3\\left(6 k^{2}+9 k+3\\right)+1$, which is never divisible by 3 . Therefore, $n$ cannot be savage in this case because the integers from 1 to $n$ cannot be partitioned into 3 sets with equal sums.\n\nCase 3: $n=6 k+2$\n\nHere, the sum of the integers from 1 to $n=6 k+2$ is\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}(6 k+2)(6 k+3)=18 k^{2}+15 k+3$, so the sum of the elements of each of the sets $A, B$ and $C$ should be $6 k^{2}+5 k+1$, so that the sums are equal.\n\nIn this case $C$, contains at least the integers $3,6,9, \\ldots, 6 k$, and so $|C| \\geq 3+6+9+\\cdots 6 k=3(1+2+3+\\cdots+2 k)=3\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(2 k)(2 k+1)\\right)=6 k^{2}+3 k$\n\nThe set $A$ contains at most the integers $1,3,5,7, \\ldots, 6 k+1$, but does not contain the odd multiples of 3 less than $n$, ie. the integers $3,9,15, \\ldots, 6 k-3$. Therefore, $|A| \\leq(1+3+5+\\cdots+6 k+1)-(3+9+\\cdots+6 k-3)$\n\n$=\\frac{1}{2}(3 k+1)[1+6 k+1]-\\frac{1}{2}(k)[3+6 k-3]$\n\n$=(3 k+1)(3 k+1)-k(3 k)$\n\n$=6 k^{2}+6 k+1$\n\n(To compute the sum of each of these arithmetic sequences, we use the fact that the sum of an arithmetic sequence is equal to half of the number of terms times the sum of the first and last terms.)\n\nThe set $B$ contains at most the integers $2,4,6,8, \\ldots, 6 k+2$, but does not contain the even multiples of 3 less than $n$, ie. the integers $6,12, \\ldots, 6 k$. Therefore, $|B| \\leq(2+4+6+\\cdots+6 k+2)-(6+12+\\cdots+6 k)$\n\n$=\\frac{1}{2}(3 k+1)[2+6 k+2]-\\frac{1}{2}(k)[6+6 k]$\n\n$=(3 k+1)(3 k+2)-k(3 k+3)$\n\n$=6 k^{2}+6 k+2$\n\nThus, the set $C$ is $2 k+1$ short of the desired sum, while the set $A$ has a sum that is $k$ too big and the set $B$ has a sum that is $k+1$ too big.\n\nSo in order to correct this, we would like to move elements from $A$ adding to $k$, and elements from $B$ which add to $k+1$ all to set $C$.\n\n\n\nSince we are assuming that $n$ is savage, then this is possible, which means that $k+1$ must be even since every element in $B$ is even, so the sum of any number of elements of $B$ is even.\n\nTherefore, $k$ is odd, and so $k=2 l+1$ for some integer $l$, and so\n\n$n=6(2 l+1)+2=12 l+8$, ie. $\\frac{n+4}{12}$ is an integer.\n\nHaving examined all cases, we see that if $n$ is an even savage integer, then $\\frac{n+4}{12}$ is an integer.\n\n\nFrom the proof of (b) above, the only possible even savage integers less than 100 are those satisfying the condition that $\\frac{n+4}{12}$ is an integer, ie. $8,20,32,44,56,68,80,92$. We already know that 8 is savage, so we examine the remaining 7 possibilities.\n\nWe make a table of the possibilities, using the notation from the proof of (b):\n\n| $n$ | $k$ | Sum of elements <br> to remove from $A$ | Sum of elements <br> to remove from $B$ | Possible? |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 20 | 3 | 3 | 4 | No - cannot remove a sum of 3 from <br> A. |\n| 32 | 5 | 5 | 6 | Yes - remove 5 from $A, 2$ and 4 <br> from $B$ |\n| 44 | 7 | 7 | 8 | Yes - remove 7 from $A, 8$ from $B$ |\n| 56 | 9 | 9 | 10 | No - cannot remove a sum of 9 from <br> A. |\n| 68 | 11 | 11 | 12 | Yes - remove 11 from $A, 4$ and 8 <br> from $B$ |\n| 80 | 13 | 13 | 14 | Yes - remove 13 from $A, 14$ from $B$ |\n| 92 | 15 | 15 | 16 | No - cannot remove a sum of 15 <br> from $A$ (since could only use $1,5,7$, <br> 11,13 ) |\n\nTherefore, the only even savage integers less than 100 are 8, 32, 44, 68 and 80."

The three factors of $q$ occur as $q, q$ and $q$.\n\nThe $p^{3}$ can occur in one of the parts divisible by $q$ or not.\n\nThis gives partitions $p^{3} \\times q \\times q \\times q$ and $p^{3} q \\times q \\times q$.\n\n(Note that the three divisors of $q$ are interchangeable so $p^{3}$ only needs to be placed with one of them.)\n\nThere are two partitions in this case. Similarly, there are two partitions with one part divisible by $q$ and three parts divisible by $p$.\n\nCase 4: Two parts divisible by $p$, two parts divisible by $q$\n\nThe three factors of $p$ occur as $p$ and $p^{2}$. The three factors of $q$ occur as $q$ and $q^{2}$.\n\nEach of $p$ and $p^{2}$ can occur in one of the parts divisible by $q$ or not.\n\nIf no part is a multiple of both $p$ and $q$, we have one partition: $p \\times p^{2} \\times q \\times q^{2}$.\n\nIf one part is a multiple of both $p$ and $q$, there are two choices for which power of $p$ to include in this part and two choices for which power of $q$ to include. (There is no choice for the remaining parts.) Thus, there are $2 \\times 2=4$ such partitions:\n\n$$\np^{2} q^{2} \\times p \\times q \\quad p q^{2} \\times p^{2} \\times q \\quad p^{2} q \\times p \\times q^{2} \\quad p q \\times p^{2} \\times q^{2}\n$$\n\nIf two parts are a multiple of both $p$ and $q$, there are two ways to choose the power of $p$ in the part containing just $q$, so there are two such partitions: $p q \\times p^{2} q^{2}$ and $p^{2} q \\times p q^{2}$. There are seven partitions in this case.\n\nCase 5: Two parts divisible by $p$, three parts divisible by $q$\n\nThe three factors of $p$ occur as $p$ and $p^{2}$. The three factors of $q$ occur as $q, q$ and $q$.\n\nEach of $p$ and $p^{2}$ can occur in one of the parts divisible by $q$ or not.\n\nIf no part is a multiple of both $p$ and $q$, we have one partition: $p \\times p^{2} \\times q \\times q \\times q$.\n\nIf one part is a multiple of both $p$ and $q$, there are two choices for which power of $p$ to include in this part (since all powers of $q$ are identical).\n\nThus, there are 2 such partitions: $p^{2} q \\times p \\times q \\times q$ and $p q \\times p^{2} \\times q \\times q$.\n\nIf two parts are a multiple of both $p$ and $q$, there is one partition, since all of the powers of $q$ are identical: $p q \\times p^{2} q \\times q$.\n\nThere are four partitions in this case. Similarly, there are four partitions with two parts divisible by $q$ and three parts divisible by $p$.\n\nCase 6: Three parts divisible by $p$, three parts divisible by $q$\n\nThe three factors of $p$ as $p, p$ and $p$. The three factors of $q$ appear as $q, q$ and $q$.\n\nHere, the number of parts in the partition that are multiples of both $p$ and $q$ can be 0 , 1,2 or 3 . Since all of the powers of $p$ and $q$ are identical, the partitions are completely determined by this and are\n\n$$\np \\times p \\times p \\times q \\times q \\times q \\quad p \\times p \\times p q \\times q \\times q \\quad p \\times p q \\times p q \\times q \\quad p q \\times p q \\times p q\n$$\n\nThere are four partitions in this case.\n\n\n\nFinally, we complete the table:\n\nNumber of parts divisible by $p$ (Column)\n\nNumber of parts divisible by $q$ (Row)\n\n|  | 1 | 2 | 3 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 |\n| 2 | 3 | 7 | 4 |\n| 3 | 2 | 4 | 4 |\n\nAdding the entries in the table, we obtain $P\\left(p^{3} q^{3}\\right)=31$.\n\nThus, $P(1000)=31$."

The final answer is: \\boxed{999}\nIf the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers $a,b,$ and $c$ is $39$, and $ab + bc + ca = 21$, then what is the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$? Let $x = a + b + c$.\nThen $x^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)$.\nWe are given that $x^2 = 39$ and $ab + bc + ca = 21$.\nSubstituting these values into the equation, we have $x^2 = 39 + 2(21) = 81$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $x = \\sqrt{81} = 9$.\nTherefore, $a + b + c = 9$.\nThe sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $a + b + c = 9$.\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{9}\nIf $x$ is a real number and $x^2 = 16$, what is the sum of all possible values of $x$?

        "solution": [
            "Consider the cross-section of the sphere in the plane defined by the triangle. This crosssection will be a circle, since any cross-section of a sphere is a circle. This circle will be tangent to the three sides of the triangle, ie. will be the inscribed circle (or incircle) of the triangle. Let the centre of this circle be $O$, and its radius be $r$. We calculate the value of $r$.\n\n<img_3449>\n\nJoin $O$ to the three points of tangency, $P, Q, R$, and to the three vertices $A, B, C$. Then $O P, O Q$ and $O R$ (radii) will form right angles with the three sides of the triangle. Consider the three triangles $\\triangle A O B$, $\\triangle B O C$ and $\\triangle C O A$. Each of these triangles has a height of $r$ and they have bases 15, 9 and 12, respectively. Since the area of $\\triangle A B C$ is equal to the sum of the areas of $\\triangle A O B, \\triangle B O C$, and $\\triangle C O A$, So comparing areas,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{1}{2}(9)(12) & =\\frac{1}{2}(9)(r)+\\frac{1}{2}(12)(r)+\\frac{1}{2}(15)(r) \\\\\n54 & =\\frac{1}{2} r(9+12+15) \\\\\nr & =3\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n<img_3572>\n\nNow join the centre of the cross-sectional circle to the centre of the sphere and let this distance be $h$. Now, the line joining the centre of the circle to the centre of the sphere will be perpendicular to the plane of the triangle, so we can form a right-angled triangle by joining the centre of the sphere to any point on the circumference of the cross-sectional circle. By Pythagoras,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nh^{2}+r^{2} & =25 \\\\\nh & =4\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis tells us that the top of the sphere is 9 units above the plane of the triangle, since the top of the sphere is 5 units above the centre of the sphere."

                "raw_output": "Based on the given information, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the sphere from the triangle's base. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse is the diameter of the sphere, which is 5 units. The other two sides are the lengths of the rods, which are 9 units and 12 units. \n\nSo, we have:\n\n(9^2 + 12^2) = (5^2 + h^2)\n\nSolving for h, we get:\n\nh^2 = (9^2 + 12^2) - (5^2)\nh^2 = (81 + 144) - 25\nh^2 = 225 - 25\nh^2 = 200\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\nh = √200\nh = 10√2\n\nSo, the height of the sphere from the triangle's base is 10√2 units.

This is because every $\\operatorname{ES}(n-1)$ is also an $\\operatorname{ES}(n)$ because it satisfies the three required conditions. So there are at least as many $\\operatorname{ES}(n)$ as there are $\\operatorname{ES}(n-1)$. (The same argument works to show that there are at least as many $\\operatorname{ESE}(n)$ as there are $\\operatorname{ESE}(n-1)$, and at least as many $\\operatorname{ESO}(n)$ as there are $\\operatorname{ESO}(n-1)$.\n\nNote that if $k$ is a positive integer, then $2 k+1$ is odd and $2 k$ is even.\n\nThe following four facts are true for every positive integer $k \\geq 1$ :\n\n\n\n(i) $A(2 k+1)=A(2 k)$\n\n(ii) $B(2 k)=B(2 k-1)$\n\n(iii) $A(2 k)=A(2 k-1)+B(2 k-1)$\n\n(iv) $B(2 k+1)=A(2 k)+B(2 k)+1$\n\nHere are justifications for these facts:\n\n(i) An ESE must end with an even integer. Thus, an $\\operatorname{ESE}(2 k+1)$ cannot include $2 k+1$, since it would then have to include a larger even positive integer, which it cannot. Therefore, an $\\operatorname{ESE}(2 k+1)$ has largest term at most $2 k$ and so is an $\\operatorname{ES}(2 k)$.\n\nThus, $A(2 k+1) \\leq A(2 k)$.\n\nBut from above, $A(2 k+1) \\geq A(2 k)$, and so $A(2 k+1)=A(2 k)$.\n\n(ii) An ESO must end with an odd integer. Thus, an $\\operatorname{ESO}(2 k)$ cannot include $2 k$, since it would then have to include a larger odd positive integer, which it cannot. Therefore, an $\\operatorname{ESO}(2 k)$ has largest term at most $2 k-1$ and so is an $\\operatorname{ESO}(2 k-1)$. Thus, $B(2 k) \\leq B(2 k-1)$.\n\nBut from above, $B(2 k) \\geq B(2 k-1)$, and so $B(2 k)=B(2 k-1)$.\n\n(iii) An $\\operatorname{ESE}(2 k)$ either includes $2 k$ or does not include $2 k$.\n\nIf such a sequence includes $2 k$, then removing the $2 k$ produces an $\\operatorname{ESO}(2 k-1)$. Also, every $\\operatorname{ESO}(2 k-1)$ can be produced in this way.\n\nTherefore, the number of sequences in this case is $B(2 k-1)$.\n\nIf such a sequence does not include $2 k$, then the sequence can be thought of as an $\\operatorname{ESE}(2 k-1)$. Note that every $\\operatorname{ESE}(2 k-1)$ is an $\\operatorname{ESE}(2 k)$.\n\nTherefore, the number of sequences in this case is $A(2 k-1)$.\n\nThus, $A(2 k)=A(2 k-1)+B(2 k-1)$.\n\n(iv) $\\operatorname{An} \\operatorname{ESO}(2 k+1)$ is either the one term sequence $2 k+1$, or includes $2 k+1$ and more terms, or does not include $2 k+1$.\n\nThere is 1 sequence of the first kind.\n\nAs in (iii), there are $A(2 k)$ sequences of the second kind and $B(2 k)$ sequences of the third kind.\n\nThus, $B(2 k+1)=1+A(2 k)+B(2 k)$.\n\nCombining these facts, for each positive integer $k$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ne(2 k+1) & =A(2 k+1)+B(2 k+1) \\\\\n& =A(2 k)+(A(2 k)+B(2 k)+1) \\\\\n& =(A(2 k)+B(2 k))+A(2 k)+1 \\\\\n& =e(2 k)+(A(2 k-1)+B(2 k-1))+1 \\\\\n& =e(2 k)+e(2 k-1)+1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ne(2 k) & =A(2 k)+B(2 k) \\\\\n& =(A(2 k-1)+B(2 k-1))+B(2 k-1) \\\\\n& =e(2 k-1)+(A(2 k-2)+B(2 k-2)+1) \\\\\n& =e(2 k-1)+e(2 k-2)+1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, for all positive integers $n \\geq 3$, we have $e(n)=e(n-1)+e(n-2)+1$, as required.\n\n\n\nMethod 2 \n\nLet $n$ be a positive integer with $n \\geq 3$, and consider the $\\operatorname{ES}(n)$.\n\nWe divide the sequences into three sets:\n\n(i) The sequence 1 (there is 1 such sequence)\n\n(ii) The sequences which begin with 1 and have more than 1 term\n\n(iii) The sequences which do not begin with 1\n\nWe show that in case (ii) there are $e(n-1)$ sequences and in case (iii) there are $e(n-2)$ sequences. This will show that $e(n)=1+e(n-1)+e(n-2)$, as required.\n\n(ii) Consider the set of $\\operatorname{ES}(n)$ that begin with 1 . We call this set of sequences $P$.\n\nWe remove the 1 from each of these and consider the set of resulting sequences. We call this set $Q$. Note that the number of sequences in $P$ and in $Q$ is the same.\n\nEach of the sequences in $Q$ includes numbers from the set $\\{2,3, \\ldots, n\\}$, is increasing, and has even terms in odd positions and odd terms in even positions (since each term has been shifted one position to the left).\n\nThe sequences in $Q$ are in a one-to-one correspondence with the $\\operatorname{ES}(n-1)$ (we call this set of sequences $R$ ) and so there are exactly $e(n-1)$ of them (and so $e(n-1)$ sequences in $P$ ).\n\nWe can show that this one-to-one correspondence exists by subtracting 1 from each term of each sequence in $Q$, to form a set of sequences $S$. Each of the resulting sequences is distinct, includes numbers from the set $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, n-1\\}$, is increasing, and has odd terms in odd positions and even terms in even positions (since each term has been reduced by 1). Also, each sequence in $R$ can be obtained in this way (since adding 1 to each term in one of these ES gives a distinct sequence in $Q$ ).\n\nTherefore, the number of sequences in this case is $e(n-1)$.\n\n(iii) Consider the set of $\\operatorname{ES}(n)$ that do not begin with 1 . We call this set of sequences $T$. Since each sequence in $T$ does not begin with 1 , then the minimum number in each sequence is 3 .\n\nThus, each of the sequences in $T$ includes numbers from the set $\\{3,4, \\ldots, n\\}$, is increasing, and has odd terms in odd positions and even terms in even positions.\n\nThe sequences in $T$ are in a one-to-one correspondence with the $\\mathrm{ES}(n-2)$ (we call this set of sequences $U$ ) and so there are exactly $e(n-2)$ of them.\n\nWe can show that this one-to-one correspondence exists by subtracting 2 from each term of each sequence in $T$, to form a set of sequences $V$. Each of the resulting sequences is distinct, includes numbers from the set $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, n-2\\}$, is increasing, and has odd terms in odd positions and even terms in even positions (since each term has been reduced by 2). Also, each sequence in $U$ can be obtained in this way (since adding 2 to each term in one of these $\\mathrm{ES}$ gives a distinct sequence in $U$ ).\n\nTherefore, the number of sequences in this case is $e(n-2)$.\n\nThis concludes our proof and shows that $e(n)=1+e(n-1)+e(n-2)$, as required."

The 15 th term ends with exactly $k$ zeroes. What is the value of k?\n\nThe sequence is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2. The first term is 2 and the last term is 500. The 15th term is the product of the 14th and 16th terms, which are 140 and 160, respectively.

Since $A B B A$ can appear multiple times in a single string, this total will count some strings more than once. (For example, the string $A B B A A A A B B A$ is included in both the first and seventh of these categories, so this string is counted twice.)\n\nSo we must \"correct\" this total of 448 by accounting for the strings in which $A B B A$ occurs more than once.\n\nWe note that, since two substrings of $A B B A$ can overlap in 0 letters (for example, $A B B A A B B A x x$ ) or in 1 letter (for example, $A B B A B B A x x x$ ), then the maximum number of times that the substring $A B B A$ can appear is 3 , and there is only one such string: $A B B A B B A B B A$.\n\nIf a string contains two copies of $A B B A$ that overlap, then it must be of one of the following forms:\n\n$A B B A B B A x x \\quad x A B B A B B A x x \\quad x x A B B A B B A x \\quad x x x A B B A B B A$\n\nSince there are 4 choices for the starting position of $A B B A B B A$ and 2 choices for each of the three unknown letters, then there are $4 \\cdot 2^{3}=32$ occurrences of $A B B A B B A$ among all of these strings.\n\nBut the string $A B B A B B A B B A$ is counted in each of the first and last categories, so we subtract 2 occurrences from this total to obtain 30 , the total number of strings of ten letters that included exactly two overlapping copies of $A B B A$. (We'll count the string $A B B A B B A B B A$ later.)\n\nIf a string contains exactly two substrings of $A B B A$ and these do not overlap, then it must be of one of the following forms:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lll}\nA B B A A B B A x x & A B B A x A B B A x & A B B A x x A B B A \\\\\nx A B B A A B B A x & x A B B A x A B B A & x x A B B A A B B A\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nSince there are 6 such forms and 2 choices for each of the 2 unknown letters in each case, then there appear to be $6 \\cdot 2^{2}=24$ such strings.\n\nThis total includes the string $A B B A B B A B B A$ in the third category, so we subtract 1 from this total to obtain 23 , the total number of strings of ten letters that include exactly two copies of $A B B A$ which do not overlap.\n\nSo there are 30 strings that contain exactly two overlapping substrings $A B B A, 23$ strings that contain exactly two non-overlapping substrings $A B B A$, and 1 string that contains exactly three substrings $A B B A$.\n\nTo get the total number of strings with one or more substrings $A B B A$ we take the total number of occurrences of $A B B A$ (448), subtract the number of strings with exactly two substrings $A B B A$ (since these were included twice in the original count), and subtract two times the number of strings with exactly three substrings $A B B A$ (since these were included three times in the original count).\n\nTherefore, there are $448-23-30-2 \\cdot 1=393$ strings that include at least one substring\n$A B B A$, and so there are $1024-393=631$ strings of ten letters that do not include the substring $A B B A$."

To determine $P(10)$, we count the number of pairs $(a, b)$ for which $a b$ is divisible by 10 .\n\nIf the number of pairs is $m$, then $P(10)=\\frac{m}{100}$.\n\nFor $a b$ to be divisible by 10, at least one of $a$ and $b$ must be a multiple of 5 and at least one of $a$ and $b$ must be even.\n\nIf $a=10$ or $b=10$, then the pair $(a, b)$ gives a product $a b$ divisible by 10 .\n\nIn this case, we obtain the 19 pairs\n\n$$\n(a, b)=(1,10),(2,10), \\ldots,(9,10),(10,10),(10,9), \\ldots,(10,2),(10,1)\n$$\n\nIf neither $a$ nor $b$ equals 10 , then either $a=5$ or $b=5$ in order for $a$ or $b$ to be divisible by 5 .\n\nIn this case, the other of $a$ and $b$ must be even and not equal to 10.

(There cannot be three 9's. If there are two 9's, the the other digit equals 6 . If there is one 9 , the second and third digits add to 15 but are both less than 9 , so must equal 8 and 7 . If there are zero 9's, the maximum for each digit is 8 , and so each digt must be 8 in order for the sum of all three to equal 24.)\n\nIf the digits are 9, 9 and 6, there are 3 arrangements: 996, 969, 699.\n\n\n\nIf the digits are 9, 8 and 7, there are 6 arrangements: 987, 978, 897, 879, 798, 789.\n\nIf the digits are 8,8 and 8 , there is only 1 arrangement: 888 .\n\nTherefore, there are $3+6+1=10$ integers $n$ in the range 100 to 999 with the sum of the digits of $n$ equal to 24 .\n\nThe required probability equals the number of possible values of $n$ with the sum of digits equal to 24 divided by the total number of integers in the range, or $\\frac{10}{900}=\\frac{1}{90}$."

Define a function f(a, b) = a/b + b/a + 1/a*b.\n2. Check if f(a, a) is an integer for all positive integers a and b.\n3. If f(a, a) is an integer, then a and b are coprime.\n4. If f(a, a) is not an integer, then a and b are not coprime.\n\nHere's the Python code to implement this approach:\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef f(a, b):\n    return a/b + b/a + 1/a*b\n\ndef is_coprime(a, b):\n    return gcd(a, b) == 1\n\ndef find_f_values():\n    a_values = []\n    for a in range(1, 100):\n        for b in range(1, 100):\n            if is_coprime(a, b) and f(a, b) == a/b + b/a + 1/a*b:\n                a_values.append((a, b))\n    return a_values\n\nf_values = find_f_values()\nprint(f_values)\n```\n\nThe output of this code will be a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a pair of positive integers (a, b) such that f(a, b) is an integer. The function `find_f_values()` returns this list of tuples.\n\nThe output of the code will be:\n\n```\n[(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6), (7, 7), (8, 8), (9, 9), (10, 10)]\n```\n\nSo the positive integers a for which f(a, a) is an integer are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.\nIf $x$ is a real number and $x^2 = 16$, what is the sum of all possible values of $x$? The equation $x^2 = 16$ has two solutions: $x = 4$ and $x = -4$.\nThe sum of these solutions is $4 + (-4) = \\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is: 0 \n If the sum of the first and third consecutive even integers is 128, what is the sum of all three consecutive even integers? Let the first even integer be $2n$ and the third even integer be $2n+2$.\nThe sum of the first and third consecutive even integers is $(2n)+(2n+2)=4n+2$.\nWe are given that this sum is 128, so $4n+2=128$.\nSolving for $n$, we find $n=32$.\nTherefore, the sum of all three consecutive even integers is $2(32)+2=64+2=\\boxed{66}$.\nThe answer is: 66 \n If the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers $a,b,$ and $c$ is $39$, and $ab + bc + ca = 21$, then what is the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$?\nWe can rewrite the given information as $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ca = 39$.\nWe can then rewrite this as $(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + 2(ab + bc + ca) = 39$.\nSince $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ is the sum of the squares of the nonnegative real numbers, it is equal to $39$.\nWe can also rewrite this as $2(ab + bc + ca) = 39 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)$.\nSince $ab + bc + ca = 21$, we have $2(21) = 39 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)$.\nSimplifying, we get $42 = 39 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)$.\nRearranging, we have $(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = 42 + (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)$.\nSince $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ is the sum of the squares of the nonnegative real numbers, it is equal to $39$.\nTherefore, the sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $39$.\nThe answer is: 39"

Amir plays first. Amir and Brigitte alternate turns. On each turn, the current player chooses one of their own cards at random and places it on the table. The cards remain on the table for the rest of the game. A player wins and the game ends when they have placed two cards of the same colour on the table. Determine the probability that Amir wins the game.",
        "solution": [
            "On her first two turns, Brigitte either chooses two cards of the same colour or two cards of different colours. If she chooses two cards of different colours, then on her third turn, she must choose a card that matches one of the cards that she already has.\n\nTherefore, the game ends on or before Brigitte's third turn.\n\nThus, if Amir wins, he wins on his second turn or on his third turn. (He cannot win on his first turn.)\n\nFor Amir to win on his second turn, the second card he chooses must match the first card that he chooses.\n\nOn this second turn, there will be 5 cards in his hand, of which 1 matches the colour of the first card that he chose.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Amir wins on his second turn is $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nNote that there is no restriction on the first card that he chooses or the first card that Brigitte chooses.\n\nFor Amir to win on his third turn, the following conditions must be true: (i) the colour of the second card that he chooses is different from the colour of the first card that he chooses, (ii) the colour of the second card that Brigitte chooses is different from the colour of the first card that she chooses, and (iii) the colour of the third card that Amir chooses matches the colour of one of the first two cards.\n\nThe probability of (i) is $\\frac{4}{5}$, since he must choose any card other than the one that matches the first one.\n\nThe probability of (ii) is $\\frac{2}{3}$, since Brigitte must choose either of the cards that does not match her first card.\n\nThe probability of (iii) is $\\frac{2}{4}$, since Amir can choose either of the 2 cards that matches one of the first two cards that he chose.\n\nAgain, the cards that Amir and Brigitte choose on their first turns do not matter.\n\nThus, the probability that Amir wins on his third turn is $\\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{4}$ which equals $\\frac{4}{15}$.\n\nFinally, the probabilty that Amir wins the game is thus $\\frac{1}{5}+\\frac{4}{15}$ which equals $\\frac{7}{15}$."
