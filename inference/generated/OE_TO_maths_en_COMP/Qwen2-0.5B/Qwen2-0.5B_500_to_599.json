            "$\\quad$ Let $z=1+x i$ and $w=1+3 x i$, where $i=\\sqrt{-1}$. Then $\\tan ^{-1} x=\\arg z$ and $\\tan ^{-1}(3 x)=\\arg w$, where $\\arg z$ gives the measure of the angle in standard position whose terminal side passes through $z$. By DeMoivre's theorem, $6 \\tan ^{-1} x=\\arg \\left(z^{6}\\right)$ and $4 \\tan ^{-1}(3 x)=\\arg \\left(w^{6}\\right)$. Therefore the equation $6 \\tan ^{-1} x+4 \\tan ^{-1}(3 x)=\\pi$ is equivalent to $z^{6} \\cdot w^{4}=a$, where $a$ is a real number (and, in fact, $a<0$ ). To simplify somewhat, we can take the square root of both sides, and get $z^{3} \\cdot w^{2}=0+b i$, where $b$ is a real number. Then $(1+x i)^{3}(1+3 x i)^{2}=$ $0+b i$. Expanding each binomial and collecting real and imaginary terms in each factor yields $\\left(\\left(1-3 x^{2}\\right)+\\left(3 x-x^{3}\\right) i\\right)\\left(\\left(1-9 x^{2}\\right)+6 x i\\right)=0+b i$. In order that the real part of the product be 0 , we have $\\left(1-3 x^{2}\\right)\\left(1-9 x^{2}\\right)-\\left(3 x-x^{3}\\right)(6 x)=0$. This equation simplifies to $1-30 x^{2}+33 x^{4}=0$, yielding $x^{2}=\\frac{15 \\pm 8 \\sqrt{3}}{33}$. Notice that $\\frac{15 \\pm 8 \\sqrt{3}}{33} \\approx 1$, which would mean that $x \\approx 1$, and $\\operatorname{so} \\tan ^{-1}(x) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{4}$, which is too large, since $6 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{4}>\\pi$. (It can be verified that this value for $x$ yields a value of $3 \\pi$ for the left side of the equation.) Therefore we are left with $x^{2}=\\frac{15-8 \\sqrt{3}}{\\mathbf{3 3}}$. To verify that this answer is reasonable, consider that $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.73$, so that $15-8 \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.16$, and so $x^{2} \\approx \\frac{7}{200}=0.035$. Then $x$ itself is a little less than 0.2 , and so\n\n\n\n$\\tan ^{-1} x \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{15}$. Similarly, $3 x$ is about 0.6 , so $\\tan ^{-1}(3 x)$ is about $\\frac{\\pi}{6} \\cdot 6 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{15}+4 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ is reasonably close to $\\pi$.",

We can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! \\div 23 = 1$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-3)! = 23$.\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we can assume that $x-3$ is a positive integer.\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as $("

The problem asks for the number of ways she can do this, and the answer is 10. \n\nThe problem statement states that Kay has 5 nails on her left hand, and she wants to paint them with at least three colors. This means that she can paint the nails in the following ways:\n\n1. All 5 nails are painted with the same color.\n2. 3 nails are painted with the same color, and the other 2 nails are painted with different colors.\n3. 2 nails are painted with the same color, and the other 3 nails are painted with different colors.\n4. 1 nail is painted with the same color as the other 4 nails.\n5. 0 nails are painted with the same color.\n\nThe first case is the only one that satisfies the condition that no two consecutive nails have the same color. The second and third cases are not possible because the number of ways to paint the nails with the same color is 5! = 120, and the number of ways to paint the nails with different colors is 5! = 120. The fourth case is not possible because the number of ways to paint the nails with the same color is 5! = 120, and the number of ways to paint the nails with different colors is 5! = 120. The fifth case is not possible because the number of ways to paint the nails with the same color is 5! = 120, and the number of ways to paint the nails with different colors is 5! = 120. \n\nSo, the total number of ways Kay can paint the nails with at least three colors is 120 + 120 + 120 + 120 + 120 = 540. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 540.\nIf $x$ is a real number and $x^2 = 16$, what is the sum of all possible values of $x$? The equation $x^2 = 16$ has two solutions: $x = 4$ and $x = -4$.\nThe sum of these solutions is $4 + (-4) = \\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is: 0 \n If the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers $a,b,$ and $c$ is $39$, and $ab + bc + ca = 21$, then what is the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$? We are given that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 39$ and $ab + bc + ca = 21$.\nWe want to find the sum $a + b + c$.\nWe can rewrite the equation $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 39$ as $(a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 39$.\nSubstituting the given values, we have $(a + b + c)^2 - 2(21) = 39$.\nSimplifying, we get $(a + b + c)^2 - 42 = 39$.\nAdding 42 to both sides, we have $(a + b + c)^2 = 81$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $a + b + c = \\pm 9$.\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonnegative, the sum $a + b + c$ is $\\boxed{9}$.\nThe answer is: 9 \n If the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers $a,b,$ and $c$ is $39$, and $ab + bc + ca = 21$, then what is the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$?\nWe can rewrite the given equations as $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 39$ and $ab + bc + ca = 21$.\nWe want to find the sum $a + b + c$.\nWe can use the identity $(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)$.\nSubstituting the given values, we have $(a + b + c)^2 = 39 + 2(21) = 81$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $a + b + c = \\pm 9$.\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonnegative, the sum $a + b + c$ is $\\boxed{9}$.\nThe answer is: 9"

This indicates that the values of $s$ \"interweave\" somewhat from one group of 10 to the next: the sets alternate between even and odd. Because the $s$-values for starting blocks of ten differ by 11, consecutive blocks of the same parity differ by 22 , so the values of $s$ do not overlap. That is, $s$ takes on 100 distinct values over any range of the form $\\{100 y+0,100 y+1, \\ldots, 100 y+99\\}$.\n\nFirst determine how many values are repeated between consecutive hundreds. Let $y$ be an integer that is not a multiple of 10 . Then the largest value for $s(100 y+k)(0 \\leq k \\leq 99)$ is $100 y+(s(y)-y)+99+s(99)=100 y+s(y)-y+117$, whereas the smallest value in the next group of 100 is for\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ns(100(y+1)) & =100(y+1)+(s(y+1)-(y+1))=100 y+(s(y)+2)-(y+1)+100 \\\\\n& =100 y+s(y)-y+101\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis result implies that the values for $s(100 y+91)$ through $s(100 y+99)$ match the values of $s(100 y+100)$ through $s(100 y+108)$. So there are 9 repeated values.\n\nNow determine how many values are repeated between consecutive thousands. Let $z$ be a digit, and consider $s(1000 z+999)$ versus $s(1000(z+1))$. The first value equals\n\n$$\n1000 z+(s(z)-z)+999+s(999)=1000 z+z+1026=1001 z+1026\n$$\n\nThe latter value equals $1000(z+1)+(s(z+1)-(z+1))=1001(z+1)=1001 z+1001$. These values differ by an odd number. We have overlap between the $982,983, \\ldots, 989$ terms and the $000,001, \\ldots, 007$ terms. We also have overlap between the $992,993, \\ldots, 999$ terms and the $010,011, \\ldots, 017$ terms, for a total of 16 repeated values in all.\n\nThere are 90 instances in which we have 9 repeated terms, and 9 instances in which we have 16 repeated terms, so there are a total of $10000-90 \\cdot 9-9 \\cdot 16=\\mathbf{9 0 4 6}$ unique values."

To find this point, we need to solve the system of equations formed by the two lines:\n\n1. y = 2x - 1\n2. y = 2x + 3\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination. Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by -1:\n\n2(2x - 1) = 2x + 3\n-2x + 2 = 2x - 3\n-2x - 2x = -3 - 2\n-4x = -5\nx = -5/4\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into either equation to find the y-intercept. Let's use the first equation:\n\ny = 2(-5/4) - 1\ny = -5/2 - 1\ny = -7/2\n\nSo the y-intercept of the line containing the altitude to AB is (-7/2).

To do this, we need to find the volume of the tetrahedron A B C F and then subtract the volume of the tetrahedron D E F.\n\nThe volume of a tetrahedron is given by the formula:\n\nV = (1/3) * |A B C F| * |A B C F| * |A B C F| * |A B C F|\n\nwhere A B C F is the base of the tetrahedron and |A B C F| is the area of the base.\n\nSince the base of the tetrahedron is a triangle, we can use Heron's formula to find its area:\n\nArea = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))\n\nwhere s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, and a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.\n\nIn this case, a = b = c = T/3, and s = (T/2) * (T/2) = T/4.\n\nSo, the area of the base is:\n\nArea = sqrt(T * (T - T/2) * (T - T/2) * (T - T/2))\n\n= sqrt(T^3/4)\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the tetrahedron A B C F:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * |A B C F| * |A B C F| * |A B C F| * |A B C F|\n\n= (1/3) * (T^3/4) * (T^3/4) * (T^3/4) * (T^3/4)\n\n= (T^3/4) * (T^3/4) * (T^3/4) * (T^3/4)\n\n= (T^9/64) * (T^3/4)\n\n= (T^3/4) * (T^3/4) * (T^3/4) * (T^3/4)\n\n= (T^9/64) * (T^9/64) * (T^9/64) * (T^9/64)\n\n= (T^3)^3 * (T^3)^3 * (T^3)^3 * (T^3)^3\n\n= (T^9)^3\n\nSo, the volume of tetrahedron A B C F is (T^9)^3 / (64 * 64 * 64) = (T^9)^3 / 1536.\n\nNow, we need to subtract the volume of tetrahedron D E F:\n\nVolume of D E F = (1/3) * |A B C F| * |A B C F| * |A B C F| * |A B C F|\n\n= (1/3) * (T^3/4) * (T^3/4) * (T^3/4) * (T^3/4)\n\n= (T^3/4) * (T^3/4) * (T^3/4) * (T^3/4)\n\n= (T^9/64) * (T^3/4)\n\n= (T^3)^3 * (T^3)^3 * (T^3)^3 * (T^3)^3\n\n= (T^9)^3\n\nSo, the volume of tetrahedron A B C F is (T^9)^3 / 1536 - (T^9)^3 / 1536 = 0.\n\nTherefore, the volume of tetrahedron A B C F is 0 cubic units.

            "The area of parallelogram $A O B X$ is given by the absolute value of the cross product $|\\langle a, m\\rangle \\times\\langle b, n\\rangle|=|a n-m b|$. Because $m=\\frac{120}{a}$ and $n=\\frac{120}{b}$, the desired area of $A O B X$ equals $120\\left|\\frac{a}{b}-\\frac{b}{a}\\right|$. Note that the function $f(x)=x-\\frac{1}{x}$ is monotone increasing for $x>1$. (Proof: if $x_{1}>x_{2}>0$, then $f\\left(x_{1}\\right)-f\\left(x_{2}\\right)=\\left(x_{1}-x_{2}\\right)+\\frac{x_{1}-x_{2}}{x_{1} x_{2}}$, where both terms are positive because $x_{1} x_{2}>0$.) So the minimum value of $[A O B X]$ is attained when $\\frac{a}{b}$ is as close as possible to 1 , that is, when $a$ and $b$ are consecutive divisors of 120. By symmetry, consider only $a<b$; notice too that because $\\frac{120 / a}{120 / b}=\\frac{b}{a}$, only values with $b \\leq \\sqrt{120}$ need be considered. These observations can be used to generate the table below:\n\n| $a, m$ | 1,120 | 2,60 | 3,40 | 4,30 | 5,24 | 6,20 | 8,15 | 10,12 |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $b, n$ | 2,60 | 3,40 | 4,30 | 5,24 | 6,20 | 8,15 | 10,12 | 12,10 |\n| $[A O B X]$ | 180 | 100 | 70 | 54 | 44 | 70 | 54 | 44 |\n\nThe smallest value is $\\mathbf{4 4}$, achieved using $(5,24)$ and $(6,20)$, or using $(10,12)$ and $(12,10)$.\n\nNote: The fact that $a$ and $b$ must be consecutive divisors of 120 can also be established by the following geometric argument. Notice that $[A O B X]=2[A O B]$. Suppose $C$ is a point on the hyperbola $y=120 / x$ between $A$ and $B$, as shown in the diagram below.\n\n\n\n<img_3796>\n\nBecause the hyperbola is concave up, $[O A C]+[O C B]<[O A B]$, so in particular, $[O A C]<$ $[O A B]$. Thus, if $[O A B]$ is minimal, there can be no point $C$ with integer coordinates between $A$ and $B$ on the hyperbola."

A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides.

            "The remainders of an integer $N$ modulo $2^{4}=16$ and $5^{4}=625$ uniquely determine its remainder modulo 10000. There are only 16 strings of four 0's and 1's. In addition, because 16 and 625 are relatively prime, it will be shown below that for each such string $s$, there exists exactly one integer $x_{s}$ in the range $0 \\leq x_{s}<10000$ such that the base- 2 and base- 5 representations of $x_{s}$ end in the digits of $s$ (e.g., $x_{1001}$ is the unique positive integer less than 10000 such that $x$ 's base- 5 representation and base- 2 representation both end in 1001).\n\nHere is a proof of the preceding claim: Let $p(s)$ be the number whose digits in base 5 are the string $s$, and $b(s)$ be the number whose digits in base 2 are the string $s$. Then the system $x \\equiv$ $p(s) \\bmod 625$ and $x \\equiv b(s) \\bmod 16$ can be rewritten as $x=p(s)+625 m$ and $x=b(s)+16 n$ for integers $m$ and $n$. These reduce to the Diophantine equation $16 n-625 m=p(s)-b(s)$, which has solutions $m, n$ in $\\mathbb{Z}$, with at least one of $m, n \\geq 0$. Assuming without loss of generality that $m>0$ yields $x=p(s)+625 m \\geq 0$. To show that there exists an $x_{s}<10000$ and that it is unique, observe that the general form of the solution is $m^{\\prime}=m-16 t, n^{\\prime}=n+625 t$. Thus if $p(s)+625 m>10000$, an appropriate $t$ can be found by writing $0 \\leq p(s)+625(m-16 t)<10000$, which yields $p(s)+625 m-10000<10000 t \\leq p(s)+625 m$. Because there are exactly 10000 integers in that interval, exactly one of them is divisible by 10000 , so there is exactly one value of $t$ satisfying $0 \\leq p(s)+625(m-16 t)<10000$, and set $x_{s}=625(m-16 t)$.\n\nTherefore there will be 16 integers whose base- 2 and base- 5 representations end in the same four digits, possibly with leading 0 's as in the example. Let $X=x_{0000}+\\cdots+x_{1111}$. Then $X$ is congruent modulo 16 to $0000_{2}+\\cdots+1111_{2}=8 \\cdot\\left(1111_{2}\\right)=8 \\cdot 15 \\equiv 8$. Similarly, $X$ is congruent modulo 625 to $0000_{5}+\\cdots+1111_{5}=8 \\cdot 1111_{5}=2 \\cdot 4444_{5} \\equiv 2 \\cdot(-1)=-2$.\n\nSo $X$ must be $8(\\bmod 16)$ and $-2(\\bmod 625)$. Noticing that $625 \\equiv 1(\\bmod 16)$, conclude that the answer is $-2+10 \\cdot 625=\\mathbf{6 2 4 8}$."

The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:\n\nSum = (n/2)(first term + last term)\n\nwhere n is the number of terms in the series.\n\nIn this case, n = 9999, the number of elements in S. The first term is 0 and the last term is 9999. So, the sum of the elements of S is:\n\nSum = (9999/2)(0 + 9999) = 499450\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when the sum of the elements of S is divided by 10,000. To do this, we can use the fact that the sum of the elements of S is 499450. \n\nTo find the remainder, we can use the formula for the remainder of a number when divided by 10,000:\n\nRemainder = (sum of the elements of S) % 10,000\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nRemainder = 499450 % 10,000\n\nCalculating the remainder, we get:\n\nRemainder = 1\n\nSo, the remainder when the sum of the elements of S is divided by 10,000 is 1.

Also $p+q+r=0$ and $p+q+s=-B$, so $r-s=B$. Substituting yields $r-5 r=-4 r=B$, so $r=-\\frac{B}{4}$ and $s=-\\frac{5 B}{4}$. From the second given equation, $p q+p s+q s=p q+s(p+q)=0$, so $p q-\\frac{5 B}{4}(p+q)=0$, or $p q=\\frac{5 B}{4}(p+q)$. Because $p+q+r=0, p+q=-r=\\frac{B}{4}$, and so $p q=\\frac{5 B^{2}}{16}$. Because $p q r=-10$ and $r=-\\frac{B}{4}$, conclude that $p q=\\frac{40}{B}$. Thus $\\frac{5 B^{2}}{16}=\\frac{40}{B}$, so $B^{3}=128$ and $B=4 \\sqrt[3]{2}$. Then $p q=\\frac{5 B^{2}}{16}$ implies that $p q=5 \\sqrt[3]{4}$ (and $r=-\\sqrt[3]{2}$ ).",

Therefore $p$ and $q$ are zeros of $4 x^{2}-B x+5 A$. [This result can also be obtained by using the Euclidean Algorithm on the original polynomials.]\n\nBecause the two quadratic equations have the same zeros, their coefficients are proportional: $\\frac{4}{B}=\\frac{5 A}{40} \\Rightarrow A B=32$ and $\\frac{4}{B}=\\frac{-B}{-A} \\Rightarrow 4 A=B^{2}$.

We are also given that a_K = 2010, where K > T. \n\nWe want to find the smallest value of K such that |K - d| is minimal. \n\nFirst, we need to find the value of d. We can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n\nwhere a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, and d is the common difference. We are given that a_1 = 10, a_2 = a_3 = 10, and a_T = 10. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n10 = 10 + (n - 1)d\n0 = (n - 1)d\nd = 0\n\nSo, the common difference d is 0. \n\nNow, we need to find the smallest value of K such that |K - d| is minimal.

Let $x = a + b + c$.\nThen $x^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)$.\nWe are given that $x^2 = 39$ and $ab + bc + ca = 21$.\nSubstituting these values into the equation, we have $x^2 = 39 + 2(21) = 81$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $x = \\sqrt{81} = 9$.\nTherefore, $a + b + c = 9$.\nThe sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $a + b + c = 9$.\nSo the answer is: \\boxed{9} The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\boxed{9} # The answer is: \\"

To find out how many minutes it would take her to swim $T$ laps, we need to convert the time from seconds to minutes. \n\nFirst, we need to convert the time from seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so:\n\n20.19 seconds = 20.19 * 60 seconds = 1209.4 seconds\n\nNow, we need to divide the total time (1209.4 seconds) by the lap time (1/5 lap time) to find out how many minutes it would take her to swim $T$ laps:\n\n1209.4 seconds / (1/5 lap time) = 1209.4 * (5 lap time) / (1/5 lap time) = 1209.4 * 5 lap time = 6047 lap time\n\nFinally, we need to convert the lap time back to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so:\n\n6047 lap time = 6047 * 60 seconds = 362820 seconds\n\nSo, it would take Lydia 362820 minutes to swim $T$ laps.

            "Let $A^{\\prime}$ and $B^{\\prime}$ be the respective feet of the perpendiculars from $O$ to $\\overline{A C}$ and $\\overline{B C}$. Let $H$ be the foot of the altitude from $C$ to $\\overline{A B}$. Because $\\triangle A B C$ is isosceles, it follows that $A^{\\prime} O B^{\\prime} C$ is a square, $\\mathrm{m} \\angle B^{\\prime} C O=45^{\\circ}$, and $\\mathrm{m} \\angle B C H=45^{\\circ}$. Hence $H$ lies on the same line as $C, O$, and $P$. In terms of $r$, the length $C H$ is $C O+O P+P H=r \\sqrt{2}+2 r+r=(3+\\sqrt{2}) r$. Because $A C=B C=\\sqrt{T-3}$, it follows that $C H=\\frac{\\sqrt{T-3}}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Thus $r=\\frac{\\sqrt{T-3}}{\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{2})}=\\frac{(3 \\sqrt{2}-2) \\sqrt{T-3}}{14}$.

Given that $E F=T$, $A F=\\frac{4 T}{3}$, and $U F=\\frac{12}{5}$, we can find the lengths of the sides of the rectangles.\n\n2. Since $E F=T$, we have $E F = \\frac{4 T}{3}$.\n\n3. Since $A F=\\frac{4 T}{3}$, we have $A F = \\frac{4 T}{3}$.\n\n4. Since $U F=\\frac{12}{5}$, we have $U F = \\frac{12}{5}$.\n\n5. Now, we can find the area of the intersection of the two rectangles. The area of the intersection is the area of the rectangle $F A K E$ minus the area of the rectangle $F U N K$.\n\n6. The area of the rectangle $F A K E$ is $A F \\cdot E F = \\frac{4 T}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4 T}{3} = \\frac{16 T^2}{9}$.\n\n7. The area of the rectangle $F U N K$ is $U F \\cdot F U = \\frac{12}{5} \\cdot \\frac{12}{5} = \\frac{144}{25}$.\n\n8. The area of the intersection is the area of the rectangle $F A K E$ minus the area of the rectangle $F U N K$, which is $\\frac{16 T^2}{9} - \\frac{144}{25}$.\n\n9. To find the numerical value of the area of the intersection, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{base} \\cdot \\text{height}$.\n\n10. The base of the intersection is $E F = \\frac{4 T}{3}$, and the height is $U F = \\frac{12}{5}$.\n\n11. Substituting these values into the formula, we get $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4 T}{3} \\cdot \\frac{12}{5} = \\frac{16 T^2}{45}$.\n\n12. Simplifying, we get $A = \\frac{16 T^2}{45}$.\n\n13. Since $T=67$, we can substitute this value into the formula to find the numerical value of the area of the intersection.\n\n14. $A = \\frac{16 \\cdot 67^2}{45} = \\frac{10676}{45} = 248$.\n\nSo the final answer is 248.\nWhat is the value of $x$ in the equation $16^{16}+16^{16}+16^{16}+16^{16}=2^x$? We can simplify the left side of the equation as $4 \\cdot 16^{16}$.\nSince $16 = 2^4$, we can rewrite the equation as $4 \\cdot 2^{4 \\cdot 16}$.\nUsing the property of exponents, we can further simplify to $4 \\cdot 2^{64}$.\nSince $2^4 = 16$, we have $4 \\cdot 16 = 64$, so the equation becomes $64 = 2^x$.\nTherefore, the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{64}$.The answer is: 64 \n If the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers $a,b,$ and $c$ is $39$, and $ab + bc + ca = 21$, then what is the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$? We can rewrite the given information as $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) = 39$.\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonnegative, we can rewrite this as $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(21) = 39$.\nSimplifying, we have $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 42 = 39$.\nRearranging, we get $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 39 - 42 = -3$.\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonnegative, we can conclude that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = \\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is: 0 \n If the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers $a,b,$ and $c$ is $39$, and $ab + bc + ca = 21$, then what is the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$? We can rewrite the given information as $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) = 39$.\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonnegative, we can rewrite this as $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(21) = 39$.\nSimplifying, we have $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 39 - 42 = \\boxed{-3}$.\nThe answer is: -3 \n If the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers $a,b,$ and $c$ is $39$, and $ab + bc + ca = 21$, then what is the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$?\nWe can rewrite the given information as $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) = 39$.\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonnegative, we can rewrite this as $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(21) = 39$.\nSimplifying, we have $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 39 - 42 = \\boxed{-3}$.\nThe answer is: -3"
