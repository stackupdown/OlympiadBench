This is a notation used in the problem to represent a number T. \n\nNext, we need to understand the notation log_8 8. This is a notation used in the problem to represent the logarithm of 8 to the base 8. \n\nSo, the problem is asking to compute 2^(log_8 8) - 8^(log_8 2). \n\nTo do this, we can use the property of logarithms that log_8 8 = 1. \n\nSo, 2^(log_8 8) = 2^1 = 2. \n\nNow, we can substitute this value into the expression 2^(log_8 8) - 8^(log_8 2). \n\n2^(log_8 8) - 8^(log_8 2) = 2 - 8 = -6. \n\nSo, the final answer is -6. \n\nThe solution to the problem is -6.\nIf $x$ is a real number and $x^2 = 16$, what is the sum of all possible values of $x$?

We can rewrite the given information as $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) = 39$.\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonnegative, we can rewrite this as $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) = (a + b + c)^2$.\nSubstituting $ab + bc + ca = 21$, we have $(a + b + c)^2 = 39 + 21 = 60$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $a + b + c = \\pm 10$.\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonnegative, the sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $\\boxed{10}$.\nThe answer is: 10 \n If the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers $a,b,$ and $c$ is $39$, and $ab + bc + ca = 21$, then what is the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$?

Using the right angles of $M N O P$ and complementary acute angles in triangles $A M P, B N M$, $C O N$, and $D P O$, note that\n\n$$\n\\angle A M P \\cong \\angle B N M \\cong \\angle C O N \\cong D P O\n$$\n\nAlso note that $\\mathrm{m} \\angle B M N=180^{\\circ}-\\left(90^{\\circ}+\\mathrm{m} \\angle A M P\\right)$, so it also follows that\n\n$$\n\\angle B M N \\cong \\angle C N O \\cong \\angle D O P \\cong A P M\n$$\n\n<img_3526>\n\nThus, by side-angle-side congruence, it follows that $\\triangle A M P \\cong \\triangle C O N$ and $\\triangle B N M \\cong \\triangle D P O$. Moreover, by side-angle-side similarity, it follows that $\\triangle A M P \\sim \\triangle B N M \\sim \\triangle C O N \\sim \\triangle D P O$. Thus $B N=s-b, N C=b$, $C O=a$, and $O D=s-a$. The similarity relation implies $\\frac{A M}{B N}=\\frac{A P}{B M}$, so $\\frac{a}{s-b}=\\frac{b}{s-a}$. Cross-multiplying, rearranging, and simplifying yields $s(a-b)=(a+b)(a-b)$. Thus either $a=b$ or $s=a+b$. In the case where $a=b, A M=A P=\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}}=\\sqrt{2}$, so $M N=(s-\\sqrt{2}) \\sqrt{2}=s \\sqrt{2}-2$. With $T=36, s=6$, and the answer is thus $6 \\sqrt{\\mathbf{2}}-\\mathbf{2}$. For completeness, it remains to verify that for this particular value of $s$, the case where $s=a+b$ is impossible. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem in $\\triangle M A P$ yields $a^{2}+b^{2}=4$. Now if $s=6=a+b$, then by squaring, it would follow that $a^{2}+b^{2}+2 a b=36 \\Longrightarrow 4+2 a b=36 \\Longrightarrow a b=16$. But the equation $a+b=a+\\frac{16}{a}=6$ has no real solutions, thus $a+b \\neq 6$. (Alternatively, note that by the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality, $a+\\frac{16}{a} \\geq 2 \\sqrt{a \\cdot \\frac{16}{a}}=8>6$.)"

                "raw_output": "Based on the problem statement, we need to find the probability that Aditya and Ayesha choose the same set of four letters. \n\n1. First, we need to find the total number of possible sets of four letters that can be chosen from the first half of the alphabet (A-M) and the second half of the alphabet (N-Z). This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\n   C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n\n   where n is the total number of letters in the alphabet, k is the number of letters to choose, and ! denotes factorial.\n\n   For the first half of the alphabet, there are 13 letters, so n = 13. For the second half of the alphabet, there are 13 letters, so k = 2. Therefore, the total number of possible sets of four letters is:\n\n   C(13, 4) = 13! / (4! * (13-4)!) = 13! / (4! * 9!) = 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 = 1,320\n\n   For the second half of the alphabet, there are 13 letters, so k = 2. Therefore, the total number of possible sets of four letters is:\n\n   C(13, 4) = 13! / (4! * (13-4)!) = 13! / (4! * 9!) = 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 = 1,320\n\n2. Now, we need to find the number of sets of four letters that Aditya and Ayesha choose. There are 13 letters in the first half of the alphabet and 13 letters in the second half of the alphabet, so there are 26 letters in total. The number of sets of four letters that Aditya and Ayesha choose is:\n\n   C(26, 4) = 26! / (4! * (26-4)!) = 26! / (4! * 22!) = 26 * 25 * 24 * 23 = 1,512,000\n\n3. Finally, we need to find the probability that Aditya and Ayesha choose the same set of four letters. The probability of choosing the same set of four letters is the ratio of the number of sets of four letters that Aditya and Ayesha choose to the total number of possible sets of four letters:\n\n   P(Aditya and Ayesha choose the same set of four letters) = (number of sets of four letters that Aditya and Ayesha choose) / (total number of possible sets of four letters) = 1,512,000 / 1,320,000 = 1\n\nSo, the probability that Aditya and Ayesha choose the same set of four letters is 1.

        "solution": [
            "First we prove that every sequence of five consecutive positive integers contains a cromulent element.\n\nProof: Consider a sequence of five consecutive integers. Exactly one number in such a sequence will be a multiple of 5 , but that number could also be a multiple of 2 and hence share a common factor with at least one other number in the sequence. There are several cases to consider, namely whether the sequence starts with an even number or an odd number.\n\nIf the sequence starts with an even number, then the second and fourth numbers are both odd, and at least one of them is not a multiple of 3 and hence is relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence because it is neither a multiple of 2 nor 3 and hence is at least 5 away from the nearest integer with a common factor. Thus the sequence contains a cromulent element.\n\nIf the sequence starts with an odd number, then again, it contains an odd number that is not a multiple of 3 and hence is relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence, thus the sequence contains a cromulent element. In fact, it contains two such numbers if the first or last number is a multiple of 3 , and if the middle number is a multiple of 3 , then all three odd elements are cromulent.\n\n\nThe minimum number is 1 and the maximum number is 2 . One example of a sequence of length 6 with one cromulent element is $5,6,7,8,9$, 10, where 7 is the cromulent element. To show that it is not possible for\n\n\na sequence of six consecutive elements to have zero cromulent elements, consider two cases. If the sequence begins with an even number, that number is not cromulent, and one of the other five elements must be cromulent by the argument in the proof above. A similar argument establishes that one element must be cromulent if the sequence of length 6 begins with an odd number (and thus ends in an even number).\n\nOne example of a sequence of length 6 with two cromulent elements is $1,2,3,4,5,6$, where 1 and 5 are both cromulent.\n\nTo prove that a sequence of length 6 cannot have three cromulent elements, consider that the cromulent elements would all have to be odd, and one of those three would be a multiple of 3 . Because one of the even elements must also be a multiple of 3 , it is not possible for all three odd elements to be cromulent."

Every element of a sequence with $n=2$ is cromulent because any two consecutive integers are relatively prime to each other.\nFind the maximum and minimum possible number of cromulent elements in a sequence of $n$ consecutive positive integers with $n=7$.",
        "solution": [
            "The minimum number is 1 and the maximum number is 3 . One example of a sequence of length 7 with one cromulent element is $4,5,6,7,8,9,10$, where 7 is the cromulent element. To show that it is not possible for such a sequence to have zero cromulent elements, consider two cases. If the sequence begins with an even number, then it contains three odd numbers. At most one of these is divisible by 3 , and at most one is divisible by 5 , so one of the odd numbers must be divisible by neither 3 nor 5 . This odd number differs by at most 6 from each other element of the sequence, so the only prime factors it can share with another element of the sequence are 2, 3, and 5 . Because it is divisible by none of these primes, it follows that the odd number in question is cromulent. Similarly, if the sequence begins with an odd number, then it contains four odd numbers; at most two of these are divisible by 3 , and at most one is divisible by 5 , so again, one odd number in the sequence must be divisible by neither 3 nor 5 . By the same argument, this element is cromulent.\n\nOne example of a sequence of length 7 with three cromulent elements is $1,2,3,4,5,6$, 7 , where 1,5 , and 7 are all cromulent.\n\nTo prove that a sequence of length 7 cannot have four cromulent elements, consider that the cromulent elements would all have to be odd. At least one of these four odd elements must be a multiple of 3 . Because one of the even elements must also be a multiple of 3 , it is thus not possible for all four odd elements to be cromulent."

(Note that $S_{n}$ is nonempty, as the polynomial $x^{2}+(n-2) x+1$ has a discriminant of $(n-2)^{2}-4$, which is nonnegative for $n \\geq 4$.) Then $a_{n}=\\prod_{x \\in S_{n}} x$.\n\nSuppose that $a, b$, and $c$ are positive integers and $x$ is a real solution to $a x^{2}+b x+c=0$. Then $x$ must be nonzero. (In fact, $x$ must be negative.) Dividing the above equation by $x^{2}$ yields $a+\\frac{b}{x}+\\frac{c}{x^{2}}=0$, thus $r=\\frac{1}{x}$ is a solution to the quadratic equation $c r^{2}+b r+a=0$. This shows that $x \\in S_{n}$ if and only if $\\frac{1}{x} \\in S_{n}$.\n\nOne might then think that $a_{n}$ must equal 1, because one can presumably pair up all elements in a given $S_{n}$ into $\\left\\{x, \\frac{1}{x}\\right\\}$ pairs. But there is a (negative) value of $x$ for which $x=\\frac{1}{x}$, namely $x=-1$. Therefore the value of $a_{n}$ depends only on whether $-1 \\in S_{n}$. It is readily seen via a parity argument that $-1 \\in S_{n}$ if and only if $n$ is even. If $n=2 k$, then the polynomial $x^{2}+k x+(k-1)$ has -1 as a root. (In fact, any quadratic polynomial whose middle coefficient is $k$ and whose coefficients sum to $2 k$ will work.) But if $n=2 k+1$, then $a(-1)^{2}+b(-1)+c=a-b+c=(a+b+c)-2 b=(2 k+1)-2 b$ will be odd, and so $-1 \\notin S_{n}$.\n\nThus $a_{n}=-1$ when $n$ is even, $a_{n}=1$ when $n$ is odd, and finally,\n\n$$\n\\frac{a_{4}}{a_{5}}+\\frac{a_{5}}{a_{6}}+\\frac{a_{6}}{a_{7}}+\\cdots+\\frac{a_{2022}}{a_{2023}}=\\underbrace{(-1)+(-1)+(-1)+\\cdots+(-1)}_{2019(-1) \\mathrm{s}}=-\\mathbf{2 0 1 9} .\n$$"

A list with fewer than four numbers cannot produce a median and unique mode that are distinct from each other. To see this, first note that a list with one number has the same median and mode. In a list with two numbers, the mode is not unique if the numbers are different, and if the numbers are the same, the median and mode are equal. In a list of three numbers with a unique mode, the mode must occur twice. Hence the\n\n\n\nmode is equal to the middle number of the three, which is the median. Thus a list with a median and unique mode that are different from each other must contain at least four numbers.\n\nNow suppose that a list satisfying the given conditions sums to less than 12 . The mean must be greater than 1, and because the list contains at least four numbers, the mean must be exactly 2 . The median must also be greater than 1 , and if the mode is 4 , then the sum must be greater than 12 . Thus it remains to determine if a mean of 2 with mode 1 and median 3 can be achieved with a list of four or five positive integers.

            "Let $x, y$, and $\\alpha$ be as defined in the first solution. Then $C D=x$ because $A B C D$ is a parallelogram.

Express your answer in interval notation. We can factor the quadratic as $(x-1)(x-6)<0$.\nThe quadratic is negative when $x$ is between 1 and 6, inclusive.\nTherefore, the possible values for $x$ are $\\boxed{(1,6)}$.\nThe answer is: (1,6) \n If $x$ is a real number and $x^2 = 16$, what is the sum of all possible values of $x$?\nThe equation $x^2 = 16$ has two solutions: $x = 4$ and $x = -4$.\nThe sum of these solutions is $4 + (-4) = \\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is: 0"

This is a binomial probability problem, where we are flipping 3 coins and want to find the probability of getting at least one tail. \n\n2. The binomial probability formula is:\n\n   P(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\n   where:\n   - P(X=k) is the probability of getting exactly k tails in n flips\n   - C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time\n   - p is the probability of getting a tail (1/2)\n   - n is the number of flips\n\n   In this case, n = 3, k = 1, and p = 1/2.

Compute $B P$.\n\nThe problem is asking to find the length of the line segment $B P$ that is tangent to the smaller circle at $P$.\n\nThe problem can be solved using the Pythagorean theorem. The radius of the smaller circle is $r=1$, so the length of the radius of the smaller circle is $r=1$. The radius of the larger circle is $R=5$, so the length of the radius of the larger circle is $R=5$.\n\nThe problem also asks to find the length of the line segment $B P$. The line segment $B P$ is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides of lengths $r$ and $R$. The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse is $B P$ and the other two sides are $r$ and $R$.

We are given that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 39$ and $ab + bc + ca = 21$.\nWe want to find the sum $a + b + c$.\nWe can rewrite the equation $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 39$ as $(a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 39$.\nSubstituting the given values, we have $(a + b + c)^2 - 2(21) = 39$.\nSimplifying, we get $(a + b + c)^2 - 42 = 39$.\nAdding 42 to both sides, we have $(a + b + c)^2 = 81$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $a + b + c = \\pm 9$.\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonnegative, the sum $a + b + c$ is $\\boxed{9}$.\nThe answer is: 9 \n If the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers $a,b,$ and $c$ is $39$, and $ab + bc + ca = 21$, then what is the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$?\nWe can rewrite the given equations as $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 39$ and $ab + bc + ca = 21$.\nWe want to find the sum $a + b + c$.\nWe can use the identity $(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)$.\nSubstituting the given values, we have $(a + b + c)^2 = 39 + 2(21) = 81$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $a + b + c = \\pm 9$.\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonnegative, the sum $a + b + c$ is $\\boxed{9}$.\nThe answer is: 9"

        "solution": [
            "Proceed in two steps: first, determine the possible sets of side lengths for the squares; then determine which arrangement of squares produces the largest perimeter. Let the side lengths of the squares be positive integers $m \\geq n \\geq p$. Then $m^{2}+n^{2}+p^{2}=41$, so $m \\leq 6$, and because $3^{2}+3^{2}+3^{2}<41$, it follows that $m>3$. If $m=6$, then $n^{2}+p^{2}=5$, so $n=2$ and $p=1$. If $m=5$, then $n^{2}+p^{2}=16$, which has no positive integral solutions. If $m=4$, then $n^{2}+p^{2}=25$, which is possible if $n=4$ and $p=3$. So the two possible sets of values are $m=6, n=2, p=1$ or $m=4, n=4, p=3$.\n\nFirst consider $m=6, n=2, p=1$. Moving counterclockwise around the origin, one square is between the other two; by symmetry, it suffices to consider only the three possibilities for this \"middle\" square. If the middle square is the 6-square, then each of the other two squares has a side that is a subset of a side of the 6 -square. To compute the total perimeter, add the perimeters of the three squares and subtract twice the lengths of the shared segments (because they contribute 0 to the perimeter). Thus the total perimeter is $4 \\cdot 6+4 \\cdot 2+4 \\cdot 1-2 \\cdot 2-2 \\cdot 1=30$. If the middle square is the 2 -square, then one of its sides is a subset of the 6 -square's side, and one of its sides is a superset of the 1 -square's side, for a total perimeter of $4 \\cdot 6+4 \\cdot 2+4 \\cdot 1-2 \\cdot 2-2 \\cdot 1=$ 30. But if the middle square is the 1-square, then two of its sides are subsets of the other squares' sides, and the total perimeter is $4 \\cdot 6+4 \\cdot 2+4 \\cdot 1-2 \\cdot 1-2 \\cdot 1=32$.\n\nIf $m=4, n=4$, and $p=3$, similar logic to the foregoing suggests that the maximal perimeter is obtained when the smallest square is between the other two, yielding a total perimeter of $4 \\cdot 4+4 \\cdot 4+4 \\cdot 3-2 \\cdot 3-2 \\cdot 3=32$. Either of the other two arrangements yields a total perimeter of $4 \\cdot 4+4 \\cdot 4+4 \\cdot 3-2 \\cdot 3-2 \\cdot 4=30$. So the maximum perimeter is $\\mathbf{3 2}$.",
            "Let the side lengths be $a, b$, and $c$, and let $P$ be the perimeter. If the $a \\times a$ square is placed in between the other two (going either clockwise or counterclockwise around the origin), then\n\n$$\nP=3 b+|b-a|+2 a+|c-a|+3 c \\text {. }\n$$\n\nTo obtain a more symmetric expression, note that for any real numbers $x$ and $y$,\n\n$$\n|x-y|=\\max \\{x, y\\}-\\min \\{x, y\\}=x+y-2 \\min \\{x, y\\}\n$$\n\nUsing this identity,\n\n$$\nP=4 a+4 b+4 c-2 \\min \\{a, b\\}-2 \\min \\{a, c\\} .\n$$\n\nThus $P$ is the sum of the perimeters of the three, less twice the overlaps. To maximize $P$, choose $a$ to be the smallest of the three, which leads to $P=4 b+4 c$.\n\n\n\nAs in the first solution, the two possible sets of values are $c=6, b=2, a=1$ and $c=b=4$, $a=3$.\n\nIn the first case, the maximum length of the boundary is $P=4 \\cdot 2+4 \\cdot 6=32$, and in the second case it is $P=4 \\cdot 4+4 \\cdot 4=32$.

This means that:\n\na^2 + b^2 + c^2 = ab + bc + ca\n\nWe can use this equation to find the possible values of a, b, and c. \n\nFrom the equation a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = ab + bc + ca, we can express c^2 in terms of a and b:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - ab\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for c^2 into the equation a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = ab + bc + ca:\n\na^2 + b^2 + (a^2 + b^2 - ab) = ab + bc + ca\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n2a^2 + 2b^2 - ab = ab + bc + ca\n\nRearranging terms, we have:\n\n2a^2 + 2b^2 - ab - ab - bc - ca = 0\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n2a^2 + 2b^2 - 2ab - bc = 0\n\nFactoring out a, we have:\n\n2(a^2 + b^2 - ab - bc) = 0\n\nSince a^2 + b^2 - ab - bc cannot be zero, we must have:\n\na^2 + b^2 - ab - bc = 0\n\nThis equation is true for any non-zero values of a and b, so it is not necessary to find the specific values of a and b. \n\nHowever, we can still find the largest possible perimeter of the region. The largest possible perimeter occurs when the three squares are as large as possible, and the three squares are placed in a square with side length 1. \n\nThe largest possible side length of the square is 1, so the largest possible perimeter is:\n\nPerimeter = 3 * 1 = 3\n\nSo the final answer is 3.\nIf $x$ is a real number and $x^2 = 16$, what is the sum of all possible values of $x$? The equation $x^2 = 16$ has two solutions: $x = 4$ and $x = -4$.\nThe sum of these solutions is $4 + (-4) = \\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is: 0 \n If the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers $a,b,$ and $c$ is $39$, and $ab + bc + ca = 21$, then what is the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$? We are given that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 39$ and $ab + bc + ca = 21$.\nWe want to find the sum $a + b + c$.\nWe can rewrite the equation $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 39$ as $(a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 39$.\nSubstituting the given values, we have $(a + b + c)^2 - 2(21) = 39$.\nSimplifying, we get $(a + b + c)^2 - 42 = 39$.\nAdding 42 to both sides, we have $(a + b + c)^2 = 81$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $a + b + c = \\pm 9$.\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonnegative real numbers, the sum $a + b + c$ is $\\boxed{9}$.\nThe answer is: 9 \n If the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers $a,b,$ and $c$ is $39$, and $ab + bc + ca = 21$, then what is the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$?\nWe can rewrite the given information as $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) = 39$.\nSubstituting $ab + bc + ca = 21$, we have $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(21) = 39$.\nSimplifying, we get $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 42 = 39$.\nTherefore, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 39 - 42 = \\boxed{-3}$.\nThe answer is: -3"

The four zeros are distinct real numbers in arithmetic progression.\n3. The sum of the four zeros is 0, which means that the polynomial has a repeated root.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the sum of the four zeros is 0 to find the value of j. The sum of the four zeros is 0 if and only if the polynomial is a perfect square trinomial. A perfect square trinomial has the form (x - a)^2, where a is a root.

Because $d$ is an integer, $x^{2}$ is an integer, so either $x$ is an integer or irrational. The following argument shows that $x$ cannot be irrational. Applying the Angle Bisector Theorem to $\\triangle B C D$ yields $D E=c=\\frac{d}{d+7} \\cdot x$. Then $A C=2 x+c=$ $x\\left(2+\\frac{d}{d+7}\\right)$.

In this case, the angle opposite side a is 6 degrees, the angle opposite side b is 18 degrees, and the angle opposite side c is 18 degrees.\n\nSo, the ratio of side a to the sine of 6 degrees is the same as the ratio of side b to the sine of 18 degrees, and the ratio of side c to the sine of 18 degrees is the same as the ratio of side a to the sine of 6 degrees.\n\nWe can use the Law of Sines to find the measure of angle C:\n\n$\\frac{a}{\\sin 6^{\\circ}} = \\frac{b}{\\sin 18^{\\circ}} = \\frac{c}{\\sin 18^{\\circ}}$\n\nSolving for angle C:\n\n$\\sin 6^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{b}{c}$\n\nSince $\\sin 6^{\\circ} = \\frac{1}{2}$, we can solve for angle C:\n\n$\\sin 6^{\\circ} = \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{b}{c}$\n\n$c = 2b$\n\nSubstituting this into the Law of Sines:\n\n$\\frac{a}{\\sin 6^{\\circ}} = \\frac{b}{\\sin 18^{\\circ}} = \\frac{2b}{\\sin 18^{\\circ}}$\n\nSolving for angle C:\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{2b}$\n\n$\\sin 18^{\\circ} = \\frac{a}{"

We can do this by setting the two equations equal to each other and solving for $x$.\n\nSetting $y=x^{2}-|x|-12$ and $y=|x|-k$ equal to each other, we get:\n\n$x^{2}-|x|-12=|x|-k$\n\nExpanding the left side, we have:\n\n$x^{2}-|x|-12=|x|-k$\n\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\n$x^{2}-|x|+k=12$\n\nNow, we can see that the left side of the equation is always non-negative, so the only way for the left side to be equal to 12 is if $x=0$.\n\nSubstituting $x=0$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$0^{2}-|0|+k=12$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n$0+k=12$\n\nSo, $k=12$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $k$ is 12.

When the binomials in $M$ are expanded, terms in which $\\sqrt{5}$ is raised to an odd power have opposite signs, and so cancel each other out. Therefore $M$ is an integer. Because $0<\\beta<1,0<\\beta^{34}<1$, and so $M-1<\\alpha^{34}<M$. Therefore $M-1=N$. Note that $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are the roots of $x^{2}=6 x-4$. Therefore $\\alpha^{n+2}=6 \\alpha^{n+1}-4 \\alpha^{n}$ and $\\beta^{n+2}=6 \\beta^{n+1}-4 \\beta^{n}$.

First, each such term has the form $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}34 \\\\ 2 k\\end{array}\\right) 3^{34-2 k} 5^{k}$, where $2 \\leq k \\leq 15$.\n\nThus it is enough to show that the binomial coefficient is even. Because $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}34 \\\\ 2 k\\end{array}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}34 \\\\ 34-2 k\\end{array}\\right)$, it is enough to check this for $2 \\leq k \\leq 8$. Keep track of powers of 2 : $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}34 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)$ is an integer, so\n\n\n\n$\\left(\\begin{array}{c}34 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}34 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{32 \\cdot 31}{3 \\cdot 4}$ is a multiple of $2^{3} ;\\left(\\begin{array}{c}34 \\\\ 6\\end{array}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}34 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{30 \\cdot 29}{5 \\cdot 6}$ is also a multiple of $2^{3} ;\\left(\\begin{array}{c}34 \\\\ 8\\end{array}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}34 \\\\ 6\\end{array}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{28 \\cdot 27}{7 \\cdot 8}$ is a multiple of $2^{2}$; and so on.\n\nIt can also be shown that the sum of the last two terms is a multiple of 50. Again, there are plenty of factors of 5 , so it is enough to note that both terms are odd, because $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}34 \\\\ 32\\end{array}\\right)=\\frac{34 \\cdot 33}{1 \\cdot 2}=$ $17 \\cdot 33$.\n\nThanks to the initial factor of 2 in the expression for $N$ (outside the parentheses), the previous paragraphs show that $N \\equiv 2\\left(3^{34}+\\left(\\begin{array}{c}34 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right) 3^{32} \\cdot 5\\right)-1(\\bmod 100)$.\n\nNow consider the powers of 3 . Because $3^{4}=81$, we find that $3^{8}=80^{2}+2 \\cdot 80+1 \\equiv$ $61(\\bmod 100), 3^{12} \\equiv 41(\\bmod 100), 3^{16} \\equiv 21(\\bmod 100)$, and $3^{20} \\equiv 1(\\bmod 100)$. (Note: those familiar with Euler's generalization of Fermat's Little Theorem will recognize this as an example, because $\\phi(25)=25-5=20$.) Therefore $3^{32}=3^{20} \\cdot 3^{12} \\equiv 41(\\bmod 100)$ and $3^{34}=3^{2} \\cdot 3^{32} \\equiv 69(\\bmod 100)$.\n\nFinally, $N \\equiv 2(69+17 \\cdot 33 \\cdot 41 \\cdot 5)-1 \\equiv 2 \\cdot 69+10 \\cdot(17 \\cdot 33 \\cdot 41)-1 \\equiv 38+10-1 \\equiv \\mathbf{4 7}$ $(\\bmod 100)$."

There are two intersection points of that circle with $l$, one on each arc with endpoints $B$ and $C$; label the one on the major arc $P_{2}$ and on the minor $\\operatorname{arc} P_{3}$. Finally, if $P B=A B$, then $P B=A C$ by the transitive property and $P C=A C$ by the perpendicular bisector theorem, so $P B A C$ is a rhombus; $P$ is the reflection of $A$ across $\\overline{B C}$. Call this point $P_{4}$.\n\nIf $P B=B C$, then $P$ must lie on the circle centered at $B$ with radius $B C$. Considering $\\triangle P A B$, if $P A=A B$, then $P$ lies on the circle centered at $A$ with radius $A B$. Now $\\odot A$ and $\\odot B$ intersect at two points, but one of them is $C$, so the other intersection must be the location of $P$, which is $P_{5}$. The condition $P B=A B$ is impossible, because it implies that $A B=B C$, which is false because in $\\triangle A B C, \\mathrm{~m} \\angle C>\\mathrm{m} \\angle A=20^{\\circ}$, so $A B>B C$. The third possibility for $\\triangle P A B$ is that $P A=P B$, implying that the perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{A B}$ intersects $\\odot B$, which only occurs if $B C / A B \\geq 1 / 2$ (although if $B C / A B=1 / 2$, the triangle is degenerate). But $B C / A B=2 \\cos 80^{\\circ}$, and the given approximation $\\cos 80^{\\circ} \\approx 0.17$ implies that $B C / A B \\approx 0.34$. Hence the perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{A B}$ does not intersect $\\odot B$. Thus the assumption $P B=B C$ yields only one additional location for $P, P_{5}$. Similarly, $P C=B C$ yields exactly one more location, $P_{6}$, for a total of $\\mathbf{6}$ points. All six points, and their associated triangles, are pictured below.\n\n\n\n<img_3810>"

Then $g$ is periodic, because $g(x+3)=f(x)+10-\\frac{10 x}{3}-\\frac{10 \\cdot 3}{3}=g(x)$. The graph of $g$ is shown below:\n\n<img_3987>\n\nBecause $g(x)$ is the (vertical) distance between the graph of $y=f(x)$ and the line $y=\\frac{10}{3} x$, the fact that $g$ is periodic implies that $f$ always stays within some fixed distance $D$ of the line $y=\\frac{10}{3} x$. On the other hand, because $\\frac{10}{3}>\\sqrt{11}$, the graph of $y=\\frac{10}{3} x$ gets further and further away from the graph of $y=\\sqrt{11} x$ as $x$ increases. Because the graph of $y=f(x)$ remains near $y=\\frac{10}{3} x$, the graph of $y=f(x)$ drifts upward from the line $y=\\sqrt{11} x$.\n\nFor each integer $n$, define the open interval $I_{n}=\\left(\\frac{n-1}{3}, \\frac{n}{3}\\right)$. In fact, $f$ is constant on $I_{n}$, as the following argument shows. For $x \\in I_{n}, \\frac{n}{9}-\\frac{1}{9}<\\frac{x}{3}<\\frac{n}{9}$. Because $n$ is an integer, there are no integers between $\\frac{n}{9}-\\frac{1}{9}$ and $\\frac{n}{9}$, so $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{x}{3}\\right\\rfloor$ is constant; similarly, $\\lceil 3 x\\rceil$ is constant on the same intervals. Let $l_{n}$ be the value of $f$ on the interval $I_{n}$, and let $L_{n}=f\\left(\\frac{n}{3}\\right)$, the value at the right end of the interval $I_{n}$. If $n$ is not a multiple of 9 , then $l_{n}=L_{n}$, because as $x$ increases from $n-\\varepsilon$ to $n$, the floor function does not increase. This means that $f$ is actually constant on the half-closed interval $\\left(\\frac{n-1}{3}, \\frac{n}{3}\\right]$. If neither $n$ nor $n+1$ are multiples of 9 , then $l_{n+1}=l_{n}+1$. However if $n$ is a multiple of 9 , then $L_{n}=l_{n}+1$ and $l_{n+1}=L_{n}+1$. (The value of $f(x)$ increases when $x$ increases from $n-\\varepsilon$ to $n$, as well as going from $n$ to $n+\\varepsilon$.)\n\nHence on each interval of the form $(3 n-3,3 n)$, the graph of $f$ looks like 9 steps of height 1 and width $\\frac{1}{3}$, all open on the left and closed on the right except for the last step, which is open on both ends. Between the intervals $(3 n-3,3 n)$ and $(3 n, 3 n+3), f(x)$ increases by 2 , with $f(3 n)$ halfway between steps. This graph is shown below:\n\n\n\n<img_3187>\n\nOn each interval $(3 n-3,3 n)$, the average rate of change is $3<\\sqrt{11}$, so the steps move down relative $y=\\sqrt{11} x$ within each interval. At the end of each interval, the graph of $f$ rises relative to $y=\\sqrt{11} x$. Thus the last intersection point between $f(x)$ and $\\sqrt{11} x$ will be on the ninth step of one of these intervals. Suppose this intersection point lies in the interval $(3 k-3,3 k)$. The ninth step is of height $10 k-1$. Set $x=3 k-r$, where $r<\\frac{1}{3}$. Then the solution is the largest $k$ for which\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n10 k-1 & =\\sqrt{11}(3 k-r) \\quad\\left(0<r<\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\\\\nk(10-3 \\sqrt{11}) & =1-\\sqrt{11} r<1 \\\\\nk & <\\frac{1}{10-3 \\sqrt{11}}=10+3 \\sqrt{11}<20 .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBecause $0<19(10-3 \\sqrt{11})<1, k=19$ implies a value of $r$ between 0 and $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{11}}$.

The midpoint of AB is given by the average of the coordinates of A and B, which is (1, 5 + 17/2 = 12.5).\n\nNow we need to find the value of x such that the point (x, 3) lies on the perpendicular bisector of the line segment AB.

This means that the base of the square pyramid is a right triangle with legs of length n-m and n. \n\nThe problem also states that the area of the square is given by the formula A = n^2/2. \n\nTo find the area of the square, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse, which is the distance from vertex P to the apex. \n\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. \n\nIn this case, the hypotenuse is the distance from vertex P to the apex, which is n-m. The other two sides are the legs of the right triangle, which are n-m and n. \n\nSo, we have:\n\nn^2/2 = (n-m)^2 + (n-m)^2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nn^2/2 = (n^2 - 2nm + m^2) + (n^2 - 2nm + m^2)\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\nn^2/2 = 2nm + 2m^2\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\nn^2 = 4nm + 4m^2\n\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\nn^2 - 4nm - 4m^2 = 0\n\nFactoring, we get:\n\n(n - 4m)(n + 4m) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero, we get:\n\nn - 4m = 0 or n + 4m = 0\n\nSolving for n and m, we get:\n\nn = 4m or n = -4m\n\nSince the problem states that the distance from vertex P to the base is n-m, we can conclude that n = 4m. \n\nSubstituting this value of n into the formula for the area of the square, we get:\n\nA = n^2/2 = (4m)^2/2 = 16m^2/2 = 8m^2\n\nSo, the area of square A B C D is 8m^2. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 8m^2.\nIf $x$ is a real number and $x^2 = 16$, what is the sum of all possible values of $x$?

Given T = -10, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n   log_2 4^8! + log_4 2^8! = 6! * T * x\n\n2.

We need to find the number of ways to pick a team of three players that includes at least one player wearing each color. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to choose 3 players from 25 players, where at least one player wears each color.\n\n2. We can use the combination formula to calculate this number. The number of ways to choose 3 players from 25 is given by:\n\n   C(25, 3) = 25! / (3! * (25-3)!) = 25! / (3! * 22!) = 25 * 24 * 23 / (3 * 2 * 1) = 12,250\n\n3. We need to subtract the number of ways to choose 3 players that do not include any player wearing each color. This is given by:\n\n   C(25, 2) = 25! / (2! * (25-2)!) = 25! / (2! * 23!) = 25 * 24 / (2 * 1) = 120\n\n4. The number of ways to choose 3 players that include at least one player wearing each color is the total number of ways to choose 3 players minus the number of ways to choose 3 players that do not include any player wearing each color. This is given by:\n\n   C(25, 3) - C(25, 2) = 12,250 - 120 = 12,130\n\nSo, the number of students in the class is 12,130.
