The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on).

For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute). Define $E(n, k)=\\infty$ if the puzzle is impossible to solve (that is, if it is impossible to have all switches on at the end of any minute).\n\nFor convenience, assume the $n$ light switches are numbered 1 through $n$.\nFind the $E(2020,1993)$",
        "solution": [
            "First, we prove that if $n$ is even and $k$ is odd, then $E(n, k)=E(n,n-k)$.\n\n\nBecause $n$ is even, and because each switch must be flipped an odd number of times in order to escape, the total number of flips is even. Because $k$ must be odd, $E(n, k)$ must be even. To show this, consider the case where $E(n, k)$ is odd. If $E(n, k)$ is odd, then an odd number of flips happen an odd number of times, resulting in an odd number of total flips. This is a contradiction because $n$ is even.\n\nCall a switch \"non-flipped\" in any given minute if it is not among the switches flipped in that minute. Because $E(n, k)$ (i.e., the total number of minutes) is even, and each switch is flipped an odd number of times, each switch must also be non-flipped an odd number of times. Therefore any sequence of flips that solves the \" $(n, k)$ puzzle\" can be made into a sequence of flips that solves the \" $(n, n-k)$ \" puzzle by interchanging flips and non-flips. These sequences last for the same number of minutes, and therefore $E(n, k)=E(n, n-k)$.\n\n$E(2020,1993)=76$. By the above prove, conclude that $E(2020,1993)=E(2020,27)$. Compute the latter instead. Because $\\frac{2020}{27}>74$, it will require at least 75 minutes to flip each switch once. Furthermore, $E(2020,27) \\geq 76$ because the prove above implies that $E(2020,27)$ is even.\n\nTo solve the puzzle in exactly 76 minutes, use the following strategy. For the first 33 minutes, flip switch 1, along with the first 26 switches that have not yet been flipped. The end result is that lights 1 through $26 \\cdot 33+1=859$ are on, and the remaining 1161 lights are off. Note that $1161=27 \\cdot 43$, so it takes 43 minutes to flip each remaining switch exactly once, for a total of 76 minutes, as desired."

For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute).

The digit 0 only occurs in the hundreds place if the thousands digit is 2 , so look at the numbers 1 through 1999. Each non-zero digit contributes an equal number of times, so there are 200 each of $1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9$. The same applies to the tens digit, except there can be the stray digit of 1 among the numbers 2010 through 2019, but again, these do not affect the product. In the units place, there are 202 of each of the digits. Altogether, there are 602 each of $2,3,4,6,7,8$, 9, along with 20 extra instances of the digit 2 . Note that $9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2=3024 \\cdot 24=72,576$ leaves a remainder of 576 when divided by 1000 . Also $2^{20}=1024^{2} \\equiv 24^{2}(\\bmod 1000)$, so $2^{20}$ contributes another factor of 576 . The answer is therefore the remainder when $576^{603}$ is divided by 1000 . This computation can be simplified by using the Chinese Remainder Theorem with moduli 8 and 125 , whose product is 1000 . Note $576^{603} \\equiv 0(\\bmod 8)$ because 576 is divisible by 8 . Also $576 \\equiv 76(\\bmod 125)$. By Euler's totient theorem, $576^{100} \\equiv 1(\\bmod 125)$, so $576^{603} \\equiv 76^{3}(\\bmod 125)$.

Observing that $-24 \\equiv 0(\\bmod 8)$, it follows that $576^{603} \\equiv-24(\\bmod 1000)$, hence the desired remainder is 976 ."

            "Define a positive integer $n$ to be a semiprime if it is a product of exactly two (not necessarily distinct) primes. Define a lucky trio to be a sequence of three consecutive integers, $n, n+1, n+2$, each of which is a semiprime. Note that a lucky trio must contain exactly one multiple of 3. Also note that the middle number in a lucky trio must be even. To see this, note that if the first and last numbers in a lucky trio were both even, then exactly one of these numbers would be a multiple of 4 . But neither $2,3,4$ nor 4,5,6 is a lucky trio, and if a list of three consecutive integers contains a multiple of 4 that is greater than 4 , this number cannot be a semiprime. Using this conclusion and because $3,4,5$ is not a lucky trio, it follows that the middle number of a lucky trio cannot be a multiple of 4 . Hence it is necessary that a lucky trio has the form $4 k+1,4 k+2,4 k+3$, for some positive integer $k$, with $2 k+1$ being a prime. Note that $k \\neq 1(\\bmod 3)$ because when $k=1$, the sequence $5,6,7$ is not a lucky trio, and when $k>1,4 k+2$ would be a multiple of 6 greater than 6 , hence it cannot be a semiprime. Trying $k=2,3,5,6,8,9, \\ldots$ allows one to eliminate sequences of three consecutive integers that are not lucky trios, and if lucky trios are ordered by their least elements, one finds that the first three lucky trios are 33,34,35; 85,86,87; and 93,94,95.

        "solution": [
            "Call the original sequence of ten squares $T=\\left(1^{2}, 2^{2}, \\ldots, 10^{2}\\right)$. A morphed sequence is one that can be obtained by morphing $T$ a finite number of times.\n\nThis solution is divided into three steps. In the first step, a characterization of the possible final morphed sequences is given. In the second step, a lower bound on the number of steps is given, and in the third step, it is shown that this bound can be achieved.\n\nStep 1. Note the following.\n\n- The sum of the elements of $T$ is $1^{2}+2^{2}+\\cdots+10^{2}=385$, and morphs are sum-preserving. So any morphed sequence has sum 385 and a mean of 38.5.\n- The sequence $T$ has positive integer terms, and morphs preserve this property. Thus any morphed sequence has positive integer terms.\n- The sequence $T$ is strictly increasing, and morphs preserve this property. Thus any morphed sequence is strictly increasing.\n\n\n\nNow if the morphed sequence is an arithmetic progression, it follows from the above three observations that it must have the form\n\n$$\n(38.5-4.5 d, 38.5-3.5 d, \\ldots, 38.5+4.5 d)\n$$\n\nwhere $d$ is an odd positive integer satisfying $38.5-4.5 d>0$. Therefore the only possible values of $d$ are $7,5,3,1$; thus there are at most four possibilities for the morphed sequence, shown in the table below. Denote these four sequences by $A, B, C, D$.\n\n|  | $T$ | 1 | 4 | 9 | 16 | 25 | 36 | 49 | 64 | 81 | 100 |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $d=7:$ | $A$ | 7 | 14 | 21 | 28 | 35 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 63 | 70 |\n| $d=5:$ | $B$ | 16 | 21 | 26 | 31 | 36 | 41 | 46 | 51 | 56 | 61 |\n| $d=3:$ | $C$ | 25 | 28 | 31 | 34 | 37 | 40 | 43 | 46 | 49 | 52 |\n| $d=1:$ | $D$ | 34 | 35 | 36 | 37 | 38 | 39 | 40 | 41 | 42 | 43 |\n\nStep 2. Given any two sequences $X=\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{10}\\right)$ and $Y=\\left(y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{10}\\right)$ with $\\sum_{i=1}^{10} x_{i}=\\sum_{i=1}^{10} y_{i}=385$, define the taxicab distance\n\n$$\n\\rho(X, Y)=\\sum_{i=1}^{10}\\left|x_{i}-y_{i}\\right|\n$$\n\nObserve that if $X^{\\prime}$ is a morph of $X$, then $\\rho\\left(X^{\\prime}, Y\\right) \\geq \\rho(X, Y)-2$. Therefore the number of morphs required to transform $T$ into some sequence $Z$ is at least $\\frac{1}{2} \\rho(T, Z)$. Now\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\rho(T, A)=\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{10}\\left|i^{2}-7 i\\right|=56\n$$\n\nand also $\\rho(T, A)<\\min (\\rho(T, B), \\rho(T, C), \\rho(T, D))$. Thus at least 56 morphs are needed to obtain sequence $A$ (and more morphs would be required to obtain any of sequences $B, C$, or $D$ ).\n\nStep 3. To conclude, it remains to verify that one can make 56 morphs and arrive from $T$ to $A$. One of many possible constructions is given below.\n\n| $T$ | 1 | 4 | 9 | 16 | 25 | 36 | 49 | 64 | 81 | 100 |\n| ---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 6 morphs | 1 | 4 | 9 | 16 | 25 | 42 | 49 | 58 | 81 | 100 |\n| 2 morphs | 1 | 4 | 9 | 16 | 27 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 81 | 100 |\n| 8 morphs | 1 | 4 | 9 | 16 | 35 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 73 | 100 |\n| 10 morphs | 1 | 4 | 9 | 26 | 35 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 63 | 100 |\n| 2 morphs | 1 | 4 | 9 | 28 | 35 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 63 | 98 |\n| 12 morphs | 1 | 4 | 21 | 28 | 35 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 63 | 86 |\n| 10 morphs | 1 | 14 | 21 | 28 | 35 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 63 | 76 |\n| 6 morphs | 7 | 14 | 21 | 28 | 35 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 63 | 70 |\n\nTherefore the least number of morphs needed to transform $T$ into an arithmetic progression is $\\mathbf{5 6}$."

There are 4 aces in a standard deck of 52 cards.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the probability of choosing a set with no aces. There are 52 cards in the deck, and 4 of them are aces. So, the probability of choosing a set with no aces is 4/52.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the probability of choosing a set with three aces. There are 4 aces in the deck, and 3 of them are aces. So, the probability of choosing a set with three aces is 3/52.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the probability of choosing a set with all aces. There are 4 aces in the deck, and all of them are aces. So, the probability of choosing a set with all aces is 1/52.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total probability of choosing a set with no aces, three aces, and all aces. The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of choosing each set individually.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the total probability. The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of choosing each set individually.\n\nStep 7: Calculate the probability of choosing a set with no aces, three aces, and all aces.

By the Triangle Inequality on $\\triangle A B O$, the radius $r_{1}$ of circle $\\omega_{1}$ must be at least 20 .

We are given that:\n\n- The total value of the bills is 20x + 80y = 20x + 80y\n- The total value of the bills is 20x * 20 + 80y * 80 = 20x * 20 + 80y * 80\n\nWe want to find the smallest possible value of the bills, so we need to minimize x and y.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the equation:\n\n- 20x + 80y = 400\n- 20x + 80y = 400\n- 20x = 400 - 80y\n- x = 200 - 40y\n\nNow, let's substitute this expression for x into the equation for the total value of the bills:\n\n- 20x * 20 + 80y * 80 = 400 * 20 + 80y * 80\n- 400x + 6400y = 8000 + 6400y\n- 400x = 8000 + 6400y - 6400y\n- 400x = 8000\n- x = 200\n\nSo, the smallest possible value of the bills is 200.

An analogous analysis to the case of $(f(x))^{4}$ suggests that the expansion of $(f(x))^{8}$ has an $x^{10}$ term for every ordered partition of 10 into a sum of eight powers of two. Up to order, there is only one such partition: $2^{1}+2^{1}+2^{0}+2^{0}+2^{0}+2^{0}+2^{0}+2^{0}$, which yields $\\frac{8 !}{6 ! \\cdot 2 !}=28$ ordered quadruples.\n\nTherefore the coefficient of $x^{10}$ is $2+10+28=\\mathbf{4 0}$."

Similarly, because the hexagon is symmetric, $\\mathrm{m} \\angle C E F=90^{\\circ}$, so quadrilateral $B C E F$ is actually a square with side length 3 . Thus $C E=\\frac{B E}{\\sqrt{2}}=\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}$, and $[A B C D E F]=[B C E F]=\\frac{9}{2}$.\n\nAlternate Solution: Calculate the angles of the hexagon as in the first solution. Then proceed as follows.\n\nFirst, $A B C D E F$ can be partitioned into four congruent triangles. Because the hexagon is equilateral and $\\mathrm{m} \\angle A B C=\\mathrm{m} \\angle A F E=30^{\\circ}$, it follows that $\\triangle A B C$ and $\\triangle A F E$ are congruent isosceles triangles whose base angles measure $75^{\\circ}$. Next, $\\mathrm{m} \\angle A B C+\\mathrm{m} \\angle B C D=30^{\\circ}+150^{\\circ}=$ $180^{\\circ}$, so $\\overline{A B} \\| \\overline{C D}$. Because these two segments are also congruent, quadrilateral $A B C D$ is a parallelogram. In particular, $\\triangle C D A \\cong \\triangle A B C$. Similarly, $\\triangle E D A \\cong \\triangle A F E$.\n\nNow let $a=A C=A E$ be the length of the base of these isosceles triangles, and let $b=A B$ be the length of the other sides (or of the equilateral hexagon). Because the four triangles are congruent, $[A B C D E F]=[A B C]+[A C D]+[A D E]+[A E F]=4[A B C]=4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} b^{2} \\sin 30^{\\circ}=b^{2}$. Applying the Law of Cosines to $\\triangle A B C$ gives $a^{2}=b^{2}+b^{2}-2 b^{2} \\cos 30^{\\circ}=(2-\\sqrt{3}) b^{2}$. Because $4-2 \\sqrt{3}=(\\sqrt{3}-1)^{2}$, this gives $a=\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) b$. Using the given length $B E=3$ and applying the Law of Cosines to $\\triangle A B E$ gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n9 & =a^{2}+b^{2}-2 a b \\cos 135^{\\circ} \\\\\n& =a^{2}+b^{2}+\\sqrt{2} a b \\\\\n& =(2-\\sqrt{3}) b^{2}+b^{2}+(\\sqrt{3}-1) b^{2} \\\\\n& =2 b^{2} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus $[A B C D E F]=b^{2}=\\frac{9}{2}$."

So the sides chosen must be nonconsecutive. Second, if nonparallel sides $s_{i}$ and $s_{j}$ are extended, the angle of intersection is determined by $|i-j|$, as are the lengths of the extended portions of the segments. In other words, the spacing of the extended sides completely determines the shape of the triangle. So the problem reduces to selecting appropriate spacings, that is, finding integers $a, b, c \\geq 2$ whose sum is 16 . However, diametrically opposite sides are parallel, so (for example) the sides $s_{3}$ and $s_{11}$ cannot both be used. Thus none of $a, b, c$ may equal 8 .

Let $P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, P_{4}$ and $Q_{1}, Q_{2}, Q_{3}, Q_{4}$ be the intersections of the sides of the squares as shown. Let $H_{A}$ be on $\\overline{A_{3} A_{4}}$ so that $\\angle A_{3} H_{A} O$ is right. Similarly, let $H_{B}$ be on $\\overline{B_{3} B_{4}}$ such that $\\angle B_{3} H_{B} O$ is right. Then the angle by which $B_{1} B_{2} B_{3} B_{4}$ was rotated is $\\angle H_{A} O H_{B}$. Extend $\\overline{O H_{B}}$ to meet $\\overline{A_{3} A_{4}}$ at $M$.\n\n<img_3949>\n\nBoth $\\triangle H_{A} O M$ and $\\triangle H_{B} P_{3} M$ are right triangles sharing acute $\\angle M$, so $\\triangle H_{A} O M \\sim \\triangle H_{B} P_{3} M$. By an analogous argument, both triangles are similar to $\\triangle B_{3} P_{3} Q_{3}$. Thus $\\mathrm{m} \\angle Q_{3} P_{3} B_{3}=\\theta$. Now let $B_{3} P_{3}=x, B_{3} Q_{3}=y$, and $P_{3} Q_{3}=z$. By symmetry, notice that $B_{3} P_{3}=B_{2} P_{2}$ and that $P_{3} Q_{3}=P_{2} Q_{3}$. Thus\n\n$$\nx+y+z=B_{3} Q_{3}+Q_{3} P_{2}+P_{2} B_{2}=B_{2} B_{3}=3 .\n$$\n\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem, $x^{2}+y^{2}=z^{2}$. Therefore\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx+y & =3-z \\\\\nx^{2}+y^{2}+2 x y & =9-6 z+z^{2} \\\\\n2 x y & =9-6 z .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe value of $x y$ can be determined from the areas of the four triangles $\\triangle B_{i} P_{i} Q_{i}$. By symmetry, these four triangles are congruent to each other. Their total area is the area not in both squares, i.e., $9-8=1$. Thus $\\frac{x y}{2}=\\frac{1}{4}$, so $2 x y=1$. Applying this result to the above equation,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n1 & =9-6 z \\\\\nz & =\\frac{4}{3}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\n\nThe desired quantity is $\\sin \\theta+\\cos \\theta=\\frac{x}{z}+\\frac{y}{z}$, and\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{x}{z}+\\frac{y}{z} & =\\frac{x+y+z}{z}-\\frac{z}{z} \\\\\n& =\\frac{3}{z}-1 \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\mathbf{5}}{\\mathbf{4}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$"

We are given that the area of the overlapping region is 8, and we need to find the value of sin(theta) + cos(theta). \n\nFirst, we need to find the area of the overlapping region. The overlapping region is the area of the two squares minus the area of the square on top of the square on the bottom. The area of the overlapping region is the area of the square on top minus the area of the square on the bottom. \n\nThe area of the overlapping region is 8, so we have:\n\nArea of overlapping region = Area of square on top - Area of square on bottom\nArea of overlapping region = 9 - 9\nArea of overlapping region = 0\n\nThis means that the overlapping region is a square of side length 0. \n\nNow, we need to find the area of the square on top. The area of a square is given by the formula A = s^2, where s is the side length. In this case, s = 0, so the area of the square on top is 0.\n\nFinally, we need to find the value of sin(theta) + cos(theta). We can use the Pythagorean identity sin^2(theta) + cos^2(theta) = 1 to find sin(theta) and cos(theta). \n\nsin(theta) = sqrt(1 - cos^2(theta)) = sqrt(1 - 1) = 0\n\ncos(theta) = sqrt(1 - sin^2(theta)) = sqrt(1 - 0) = 1\n\nSo, sin(theta) + cos(theta) = 0 + 1 = 1. \n\nTherefore, the value of sin(theta) + cos(theta) is 1.

What is the greater of the two numbers?\nLet the two numbers be $x$ and $y$, where $x>y$.\nWe are given that $x+y=22$ and $x-y=4$.\nAdding these two equations, we get $2x=26$, so $x=13$.\nTherefore, the greater of the two numbers is $\\boxed{13}$.The answer is: 13 \n If the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers $a,b,$ and $c$ is $39$, and $ab + bc + ca = 21$, then what is the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$?\nWe can rewrite the given information as $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) = 39$.\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonnegative, we can rewrite this as $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) = 39$.\nWe can rewrite this as $(a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 39$.\nSubstituting $ab + bc + ca = 21$, we have $(a + b + c)^2 - 2(21) = 39$.\nSimplifying, we get $(a + b + c)^2 - 42 = 39$.\nAdding 42 to both sides, we have $(a + b + c)^2 = 81$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $a + b + c = \\boxed{9}$.The answer is: 9"

We have $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 39$ and $ab + bc + ca = 21$.\nWe can rewrite the first equation as $(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + 2(ab + bc + ca) = 39 + 2(21)$,\nwhich simplifies to $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) = 60$.\nWe can rewrite the second equation as $(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + 2(ab + bc + ca) = 39 + 2(21)$,\nwhich simplifies to $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) = 60$.\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get $2(ab + bc + ca) = 39$.\nDividing both sides by 2, we get $ab + bc + ca = \\boxed{19}$.\nTherefore, the sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $a + b + c = \\boxed{19}$.\nThe answer is: 19 \n If the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers $a,b,$ and $c$ is $39$, and $ab + bc + ca = 21$, then what is the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$? We can rewrite the given information as $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) = 39 + 2(21) = 60$.\nSince $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ is the sum of the squares of the nonnegative real numbers, we have $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 60 - 2(ab + bc + ca)$.\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonnegative, we can rewrite this as $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 60 - 2(21) = 60 - 42 = 18$.\nTherefore, the sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $\\boxed{18}$.\nThe answer is: 18 \n If the sum of the squares of nonnegative real numbers $a,b,$ and $c$ is $39$, and $ab + bc + ca = 21$, then what is the sum of $a,b,$ and $c$?\nWe can rewrite the given information as $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) = 39 + 2(21) = 60$.\nSince $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ is the sum of the squares of the nonnegative real numbers, we have $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 60 - 2(ab + bc + ca)$.\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonnegative, we can rewrite this as $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 60 - 2(21) = 60 - 42 = 18$.\nTherefore, the sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $\\boxed{18}$.\nThe answer is: 18"

            "Let $P=(1,1), Q=(17,1)$, and $R=(B, 7)$ be the vertices of the triangle, and let $X=(B, 1)$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $R$ to $\\overleftrightarrow{P Q}$. Let $M=(A-1,1)$ and let $\\ell$ be the vertical line through $M$; then the problem is to determine the fraction of the area of $\\triangle P Q R$ that lies to the right of $\\ell$.\n\nNote that $B \\geq 0$ and $A \\geq 0$ because they are digit sums of integers. Depending on their values, the line $\\ell$ might intersect any two sides of the triangle or none at all. Each case\n\n\n\nrequires a separate computation. There are two cases where the computation is trivial. First, when $\\ell$ passes to the left of or through the leftmost vertex of $\\triangle P Q R$, which occurs when $A-1 \\leq \\min (B, 1)$, the probability is 1 . Second, when $\\ell$ passes to the right of or through the rightmost vertex of $\\triangle P Q R$, which occurs when $A-1 \\geq \\max (B, 17)$, the probability is 0 . The remaining cases are as follows.\n\nCase 1: The line $\\ell$ intersects $\\overline{P Q}$ and $\\overline{P R}$ when $1 \\leq A-1 \\leq 17$ and $A-1 \\leq B$.\n\nCase 2: The line $\\ell$ intersects $\\overline{P Q}$ and $\\overline{Q R}$ when $1 \\leq A-1 \\leq 17$ and $A-1 \\geq B$.\n\nCase 3: The line $\\ell$ intersects $\\overline{P R}$ and $\\overline{Q R}$ when $17 \\leq A-1 \\leq B$.\n\nNow proceed case by case.\n\nCase 1: Let $T$ be the point of intersection of $\\ell$ and $\\overline{P R}$. Then the desired probability is $[M Q R T] /[P Q R]=1-[P M T] /[P Q R]$. Since $\\triangle P M T \\sim \\triangle P X R$ and the areas of similar triangles are proportional to the squares of corresponding sides, $[P M T] /[P X R]=(P M / P X)^{2}$. Since $\\triangle P X R$ and $\\triangle P Q R$ both have height $X R$, their areas are proportional to their bases: $[P X R] /[P Q R]=P X / P Q$. Taking the product, $[P M T] /[P Q R]=(P M / P X)^{2}(P X / P Q)=$ $\\frac{P M^{2}}{P X \\cdot P Q}=\\frac{(A-2)^{2}}{(B-1)(17-1)}$, and the final answer is\n\n$$\n\\frac{[M Q R T]}{[P Q R]}=1-\\frac{[P M T]}{[P Q R]}=1-\\frac{(A-2)^{2}}{16(B-1)}\n$$\n\nCase 2: Let $U$ be the point of intersection of $\\ell$ and $\\overline{Q R}$. A similar analysis to the one in the previous case yields\n\n$$\n\\frac{[M Q U]}{[P Q R]}=\\frac{[M Q U]}{[X Q R]} \\cdot \\frac{[X Q R]}{[P Q R]}=\\left(\\frac{M Q}{X Q}\\right)^{2} \\frac{X Q}{P Q}=\\frac{(18-A)^{2}}{16(17-B)}\n$$\n\nCase 3: Let $T$ be the point of intersection of $\\ell$ and $\\overline{P R}$ and let $U$ be the point of intersection of $\\ell$ and $\\overline{Q R}$ as in the previous cases. Let $S$ be the point on $\\overline{P R}$ such that $\\overline{Q S} \\perp \\overline{P Q}$. Then $\\triangle T U R \\sim \\triangle S Q R$, so the areas of these two triangles are proportional to the squares of the corresponding altitudes $M X$ and $Q X$. Thinking of $\\overleftrightarrow{P R}$ as the common base, $\\triangle S Q R$ and $\\triangle P Q R$ have a common altitude, so the ratio of their areas is $S R / P R$. Since $\\triangle P Q S \\sim$ $\\triangle P X R, P S / P R=P Q / P X$ and so $\\frac{S R}{P R}=1-\\frac{P S}{P R}=1-\\frac{P Q}{P X}=\\frac{Q X}{P X}$. Therefore the desired probability is\n\n$$\n\\frac{[T U R]}{[P Q R]}=\\frac{[T U R]}{[S Q R]} \\cdot \\frac{[S Q R]}{[P Q R]}=\\left(\\frac{M X}{Q X}\\right)^{2} \\frac{Q X}{P X}=\\frac{(B-A+1)^{2}}{(B-17)(B-1)}\n$$\n\nUsing the answers from positions 7 and $9, A=4+1+4=9$ and $B=2+7=9$. The first case applies, so the probability is\n\n$$\n1-\\frac{(9-2)^{2}}{16(9-1)}=1-\\frac{49}{128}=\\frac{\\mathbf{7 9}}{\\mathbf{1 2 8}}\n$$"

We can set up the following equations:\n\n1. x + y = 3 (since the longer base is 3 units longer than the shorter base)\n2. xy = T + 1 (since the area of the trapezoid is T+1)\n3. y = x - 3 (since the shorter base is 3 units shorter than the longer base)\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the third equation, we get:\n\nx(x - 3) = T + 1\nx^2 - 3x = T + 1\nx^2 - 3x - T - 1 = 0\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation for x. The discriminant of this quadratic equation is:\n\nD = b^2 - 4ac\nD = (-3)^2 - 4(1)(-T - 1)\nD = 9 + 4T + 4\nD = 9 + 4(T - 1)\nD = 9 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T\n\nSince the longer base is 3 units longer than the shorter base, we have:\n\nx = y + 3\nx = y + 3\nx - y = 3\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for D, we get:\n\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4(T - 1)\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + 4T - 4\nD = 5 + "
